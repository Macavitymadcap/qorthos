# KATHRULA

The ‘city of floating spires’ is the only remaining vestige of the Mamrielyon
Empire on the Scar. Though most of their knowledge and secrets faded from the
world during the Gods’ Wars, which cracked asunder the continent of Mamrielos,
some of the arcane wonders they weaved remained in the small university town of
Kathrula.

Over the millenia in the wake of the Deracination, the university gained renown
as a prestigious institute of learning. The influx of students broadened the
population, though an elven majority remains. The city state is a magocracy,
governed by the Archchancellor of the university, advised by civic leaders,
merchants, and the deans of the colleges.

There exists some minor tension between town and gown. While most citizens
appreciate the cultural, economic and practical benefits a large university
brings to a town (for example, the sewers beneath the city release their waste
through one-way holes into voidspace), some residents resent the privileged
students, their strange loud music and rampant cavorting.

Kathrula and the Confederacy have a lax relationship. While it provided great
aid during the war against Zilrikax (not least of all in the form of **Orla
Nopenstallen**, an alumnus and one of the Children of the Scar), Kathrula
withdrew into it’s insular ways once the illithlich was defeated. On the one
hand they welcome the Confederacy, and the Archchancellor’s word carries great
weight on The Council; but on the other hand Kathrula does things its own way,
without interference. The Bladesingers, not the Confederate Guard, maintain law
and order in the city. The Guard are present in town, but serve a mainly
administrative role. Kathrula upholds the Confederate Statutes, but as little as
possible so that it may maintain its heritage.

The architecture is mostly elven, but in places augmented by magic, especially
on the campuses: many have been reduced to tears just trying to leave the
College of Illusion. The Nexus, a huge tower that sports a cloud piercing
floating spire, dominates the centre. The other districts radiate out from it on
a fractal grid.\
The physical area of the city is quite small, but years of thaumic tinkering
with the Mamrielyon’s Mythals have allowed the Kathrulans to fold spaces upon
itself, essentially doubling the city limits. The ground is famously flat, but
through their manipulations they have created hills linking the neighbourhoods
and districts that offer a fractal vista of the city to those traversing them.

# UNIVERSITY CIRCLE

The heart of the city is quite literally the university: its campuses and the
Nexus are its geographic centre, and the latter also houses the government of
Kathrula. The colleges are spread out over two semi-circles surrounding the
Nexus; the Mundane on the west, the Arcane on the East. Parks and greenspaces
are interspersed between the colleges, and home to many creatures more usually
found in Faerie.

Some of the buildings in University Circle are among the oldest in the
Confederacy, and thanks to ancient Mythals still intact, magically enhanced. The
stonework of these buildings is smooth and joinless. Elegant arches and curves
woven naturally from the rock, in some cases the contours following the
striations of the rock, blend effortlessly with the landscape.

## THE ARCANE CAMPUS

The magical nature of what goes on in this district is obvious to anyone who
walks around it. Many buildings float, linked to the ground and each other by
transportation circles. It is also home to various student enterprises and
experiments, such as; wishing wells that can predict the weather accurately, or
your money back; skeletons armed with mops & brushes utilised as cleaners and
Conjuring Booths that summon food and drink.

The crashes, bangs, and other noises emitted by spellcasting echo around the
Arcane Campus. The air has a sulphurous tinge, and the whole area a faint
rainbow aura, as if it were enclosed in a raindrop reflecting the sun. Despite
Kathrula’s northerly position, the temperature on campus fluctuates with the
flow of magical energy bounding around the colleges.

### NOTABLE LOCATIONS

- The Blinded Nothic: A lively student pub that often hosts quizzes,
  performances and other such events. It is owned by **Oritan Mance**, a human
  male.
- The College of Abjuration: The most secure of all the colleges, it is
  protected by wards that prevent anyone other than staff or students from
  entering. **Glaucia Yrvin**, a human female, is currently the dean.
- The College of Conjuration: The dean is **Bree Stonebridge**, a halfling
  female.
- The College of Divination: The most elusive of the colleges, the College of
  Divination is well guarded and often relied upon by the Confederate Council to
  determine the validity of plans. The office of dean is held by **Dorn**, a
  half-orc male.
- The College of Enchantment: The simplest in design, but most beguiling of the
  colleges, the halls of the school have enticed many who have never found any
  reason to leave, and cannot remember how they got there. **Naivara Wasanthi**,
  a female elf, is dean,
- The College of Evocation: perhaps the most impressive of the colleges, given
  that it floats 100 feet above the quadrangle. The only way in and out of the
  college is by teleportation circle, with one found directly below it. **Carric
  Xiloscient**, a male elf, is the Dean.
- The College of Illusion: Legendarily difficult to navigate due to its many
  false walls and floors. The building is rife with sights, smells, sounds and
  sensations, often the result of student pranks and experiments. It is
  currently overseen by **Fezrick Thrungaldis**, a gnome male.
- The College of Necromancy: Home to the Confederacy’s Undead Reclamation
  Project, and beneath it lies The Cadavertoir, Mamrielyon tombs converted into
  a necromantic laboratory. The current dean is **Radomir Vrakanovich**, a human
  male.
- The College of Transmutation: Constructed from various transmuted materials,
  the College is riddled with changeable features, like statues representing
  different people at the click of a button or matter converters that can turn
  wood into lead, for a price. The Dean is **Rua**, a female firbolg.
- St. Efferil’s: Temple to Orthalius and communal library and archives managed
  by First Reader **Direcres Ghaallixirn**, a male dragonborn.

## THE MUNDANE CAMPUS

The chaotic sprawl of the Arcane Campus is mirrored by the orderly quadrangles
and colleges of the Mundane Campus. Though magical architecture still abounds on
this side of the university, it is less obvious, like folded space, or the mage
lamps illuminating the streets (from which the whole city benefits). Classical
spires (all earthbound) adorn the colleges, and the parks between them are home
to less exotic flora and fauna.

Though the nature of study here is quiet, students are still young people and
their chatter and japery cuts through the quietude of learning. The noise of the
neighbouring Mercantile and cultural third also bleeds into campus, along with a
suffusion of floral aromas from the parks and the questionable hygiene of young
adults.

### NOTABLE LOCATIONS

- The College of Arts: Teaching painting, architecture, sculpture, literature,
  music, and theatre, this college has possibly the largest scope in the
  university, and gains the most affection from the town’s elven, culture loving
  majority. The college hosts a theatre, gallery, exhibition space and library
  that archive and show all of its student’s work for the benefit of the town.
  Female elf.
- The College of Engineering: male dwarf
- The College of Languages: **Symma Garrick** female gnome
- The College of Mathematics: female elf
- The College of Medicine: All the healing arts, whether they be alchemical,
  divine, mundane or other are embraced by the faculty here. The University
  Hospital on its grounds is one of the oldest places of freely accessible
  healing on the scar, **Empathy Gadreel**, a female tiefling, is currently dean
  of the college.
- The College of Philosophy: **Za Ethanasath**, a non-binary elf is the dean of
  this building which encompases philosophy in both its normal and natural
  varieties.
- The College of Personities: Male elf.
- The College of Theology: human female
- St. Myathethil’s: Temple to Færunda and a communal workshop open to town and
  gown alike operated by Grandmason **Dayereth Mellerelel**, a male elf.
- The Old Perpendicular: A student pub that gets its name from the fact that, in
  ordinary space, it is at a right angle to the main street leading to the
  arcane campus. Because of Kathrula’s non-euclidian town planning, however, it
  appears to most onlookers to be nowhere near the other campus. The landlady is
  **Dara Berevan**, an elf.

## THE NEXUS

Although the nexus is not infinitely long, the effect of looking at it is such
that it does not seem to stop going up until you cast you gaze away from it.
Aside from it’s mind-boggling proportions and floating spire, its smooth
obsidian is embellished and supported by levitating buttresses that stick out
from it like spider’s legs, hovering over the rest of the university.

Each of it’s floors is roughly mansioned sized, and given over to a different
civic administration/ The nexus also serves as the university’s offices and
student guildhall. With so much variety, each floor differs wildly in flavour,
though they all share in the glory of Old Mamriel that rings through the spire
in its intricate, flowing and rhythmic architecture and murals.

### NOTABLE LOCATIONS

- The Administrative Floor
- The Archancellor’s Spire
- The Council Chambers
- The Faculty Lounge
- The Hall of Bladesingers: An order of elven warriors who serve as Kathrula’s
  main provider of law, order, and security. Their commander is **Jarsali
  Tiltathana**, a female elf.
- The Student’s Guildhall

# THE OUTER RING

The ‘gowns’ are encircled by the town that makes Kathrula more than just a
university. Reflecting its elven heritage, culture and nature are prominent
throughout the residential and business districts of the city. Entire
neighbourhoods are suspended in the canopies of small woods in the Village,
while the village third sports workshops grown from flora and fungi,

The Arts are as vital to Kathrula as magic, evinced not only by an entire
district of theatres, galleries and such but also by the striking murals on the
most ordinary of street corners, the buskers who are respected members of
community rather than considered nuisances. The town weaves neighbourhoods in
between parks, blending architecture and horticulture.
