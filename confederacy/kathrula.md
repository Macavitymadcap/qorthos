# KATHRULA

The 'city of floating spires' is the only remaining vestige of the Mamrielyon
Empire on the Scar. Though most of their knowledge and secrets faded from the
world during the Gods' Wars, which cracked asunder the continent of Mamrielos,
some of the arcane wonders they weaved remained in the small university town of
Kathrula.

Over the millenia in the wake of the Deracination, the university gained renown
as a prestigious institute of learning. The influx of students broadened the
population, though an elven majority remains. The city state is a magocracy,
governed by the Archchancellor of the university, advised by civic leaders,
merchants, and the deans of the colleges.

There exists some minor tension between town and gown. While most citizens
appreciate the cultural, economic and practical benefits a large university
brings to a town (for example, the sewers beneath the city release their waste
through one-way holes into voidspace), some residents resent the privileged
students, their strange loud music and rampant cavorting.

Kathrula and the Confederacy have a lax relationship. While it provided great
aid during the war against Zilrikax (not least of all in the form of **Orla
Nopenstallen**, an alumnus and one of the Children of the Scar), Kathrula
withdrew into its insular ways once the illithlich was defeated. On the one hand
they welcome the Confederacy, and the Archchancellor's word carries great weight
on The Council; but on the other hand Kathrula does things its own way, without
interference. The Bladesingers, not the Confederate Guard, maintain law and
order in the city. The Guard are present in town, but serve a mainly
administrative role. Kathrula upholds the Confederate Statutes, but as little as
possible so that it may maintain its heritage.

The architecture is mostly elven, but in places augmented by magic, especially
on the campuses: many have been reduced to tears just trying to leave the
College of Illusion. The Nexus, a huge tower that sports a cloud piercing
floating spire, dominates the centre. The other districts radiate out from it on
a fractal grid.\
The physical area of the city is quite small, but years of thaumic tinkering
with the Mamrielyon's Mythals have allowed the Kathrulans to fold spaces upon
itself, essentially doubling the city limits. The ground is famously flat, but
through their manipulations they have created hills linking the neighbourhoods
and districts that offer a fractal vista of the city to those traversing them.

# UNIVERSITY CIRCLE

The heart of the city is quite literally the university: its campuses and the
Nexus are its geographic centre, and the latter also houses the government of
Kathrula. The colleges are spread out over two semi-circles surrounding the
Nexus; the Mundane on the west, the Arcane on the East. Parks and greenspaces
are interspersed between the colleges, and home to many creatures more usually
found in Faerie.

Some of the buildings in University Circle are among the oldest in the
Confederacy, and thanks to ancient Mythals still intact, magically enhanced. The
stonework of these buildings is smooth and joinless. Elegant arches and curves
woven naturally from the rock, in some cases the contours following the
striations of the rock, blend effortlessly with the landscape.

## THE ARCANE CAMPUS

The magical nature of what goes on in this district is obvious to anyone who
walks around it. Many buildings float, linked to the ground and each other by
transportation circles. It is also home to various student enterprises and
experiments, such as; wishing wells that can predict the weather accurately, or
your money back; skeletons armed with mops & brushes utilised as cleaners and
Conjuring Booths that summon food and drink.

The crashes, bangs, and other noises emitted by spellcasting echo around the
Arcane Campus. The air has a sulphurous tinge, and the whole area a faint
rainbow aura, as if it were enclosed in a raindrop reflecting the sun. Despite
Kathrula's northerly position, the temperature on campus fluctuates with the
flow of magical energy bounding around the colleges.

### NOTABLE LOCATIONS

- The Blinded Nothic: A lively student pub that often hosts quizzes,
  performances and other such events. It is owned by **Oritan Mance**, a human
  male.
- The College of Abjuration: The most secure of all the colleges, it is
  protected by wards that prevent anyone other than staff or students from
  entering. **Glaucia Yrvin**, a human female, is currently the dean.
- The College of Conjuration: The dean is **Bree Stonebridge**, a halfling
  female.
- The College of Divination: The most elusive of the colleges, the College of
  Divination is well guarded and often relied upon by the Confederate Council to
  determine the validity of plans. The office of dean is held by **Dorn**, a
  half-orc male.
- The College of Enchantment: The simplest in design, but most beguiling of the
  colleges, the halls of the school have enticed many who have never found any
  reason to leave, and cannot remember how they got there. **Naivara Wasanthi**,
  a female elf, is dean,
- The College of Evocation: perhaps the most impressive of the colleges, given
  that it floats 100 feet above the quadrangle. The only way in and out of the
  college is by teleportation circle, with one found directly below it. **Carric
  Xiloscient**, a male elf, is the Dean.
- The College of Illusion: Legendarily difficult to navigate due to its many
  false walls and floors. The building is rife with sights, smells, sounds and
  sensations, often the result of student pranks and experiments. It is
  currently overseen by **Fezrick Thrungaldis**, a gnome male.
- The College of Necromancy: Home to the Confederacy's Undead Reclamation
  Project, and beneath it lies The Cadavertoir, Mamrielyon tombs converted into
  a necromantic laboratory. The current dean is **Radomir Vrakanovich**, a human
  male.
- The College of Transmutation: Constructed from various transmuted materials,
  the College is riddled with changeable features, like statues representing
  different people at the click of a button or matter converters that can turn
  wood into lead, for a price. The Dean is **Rua**, a female firbolg.
- St. Efferil's: Temple to Orthalius and communal library and archives managed
  by First Reader **Direcres Ghaallixirn**, a male dragonborn.

## THE MUNDANE CAMPUS

The chaotic sprawl of the Arcane Campus is mirrored by the orderly quadrangles
and colleges of the Mundane Campus. Though magical architecture still abounds on
this side of the university, it is less obvious, like folded space, or the mage
lamps illuminating the streets (from which the whole city benefits). Classical
spires (all earthbound) adorn the colleges, and the parks between them are home
to less exotic flora and fauna.

Though the nature of study here is quiet, students are still young people and
their chatter and japery cuts through the quietude of learning. The noise of the
neighbouring Mercantile and cultural third also bleeds into campus, along with a
suffusion of floral aromas from the parks and the questionable hygiene of young
adults.

### NOTABLE LOCATIONS

- The College of Arts: Teaching painting, architecture, sculpture, literature,
  music, and theatre, this college has possibly the largest scope in the
  university, and gains the most affection from the town's elven, culture loving
  majority. The college hosts a theatre, gallery, exhibition space and library
  that archive and show all of its student's work for the benefit of the town.
  The dean is **Sylphenia Valeris**, a female elf known for her masterful
  paintings that seem to capture emotions as well as images.
- The College of Engineering: A marvel of precise construction and innovative
  design, where students learn to combine magical theory with practical
  application. The dean, **Torgin Ironheart**, a male dwarf whose family has
  served as master craftsmen for generations, ensures that graduates can build
  structures that withstand both physical and magical stresses.
- The College of Languages: Renowned for its vast collection of texts in
  hundreds of languages, including several thought extinct. **Symma Garrick**, a
  female gnome with an uncanny ability to detect subtle dialectical differences,
  serves as dean and oversees the translation of ancient manuscripts recovered
  from ruins across the Scar.
- The College of Mathematics: Home to scholars who study the fundamental
  patterns underlying both the physical world and magical theory. The dean,
  **Elanil Starsong**, a female elf whose calculations predicted several
  astronomical phenomena with perfect accuracy, encourages students to seek the
  mathematical principles behind even the most chaotic magical effects.
- The College of Medicine: All the healing arts, whether they be alchemical,
  divine, mundane or other are embraced by the faculty here. The University
  Hospital on its grounds is one of the oldest places of freely accessible
  healing on the scar, **Empathy Gadreel**, a female tiefling, is currently dean
  of the college.
- The College of Philosophy: **Za Ethanasath**, a non-binary elf is the dean of
  this building which encompasses philosophy in both its normal and natural
  varieties.
- The College of Personities: A unique institution devoted to the study of how
  different races and cultures interact and develop their identities. The dean,
  **Tharivol Moondancer**, a male elf whose research on cross-cultural
  communication has facilitated numerous diplomatic breakthroughs, encourages
  students to experience diverse societies firsthand as part of their education.
- The College of Theology: Where the doctrines and practices of various faiths
  are studied academically, with particular emphasis on understanding the
  effects of the Deracination on religious development. The dean, **Moira
  Lightkeeper**, a human female whose balanced approach has earned respect from
  clerics of various faiths, maintains a distinction between theological study
  and religious practice.
- St. Myathethil's: Temple to Færunda and a communal workshop open to town and
  gown alike operated by Grandmason **Dayereth Mellerelel**, a male elf.
- The Old Perpendicular: A student pub that gets its name from the fact that, in
  ordinary space, it is at a right angle to the main street leading to the
  arcane campus. Because of Kathrula's non-euclidian town planning, however, it
  appears to most onlookers to be nowhere near the other campus. The landlady is
  **Dara Berevan**, an elf.

## THE NEXUS

Although the nexus is not infinitely long, the effect of looking at it is such
that it does not seem to stop going up until you cast you gaze away from it.
Aside from its mind-boggling proportions and floating spire, its smooth obsidian
is embellished and supported by levitating buttresses that stick out from it
like spider's legs, hovering over the rest of the university.

Each of its floors is roughly mansion sized, and given over to a different civic
administration. The nexus also serves as the university's offices and student
guildhall. With so much variety, each floor differs wildly in flavour, though
they all share in the glory of Old Mamriel that rings through the spire in its
intricate, flowing and rhythmic architecture and murals.

### NOTABLE LOCATIONS

- The Administrative Floor: Where the daily operations of both city and
  university are managed by a staff of skilled bureaucrats. The space features
  enchanted record-keeping systems that maintain perfect archives dating back
  centuries, with documents organizing themselves according to relevance and
  importance.
- The Archchancellor's Spire: The highest level of the Nexus, accessible only by
  special teleportation circles. Here, the current Archchancellor **Maelora
  Starweaver**, an ancient elf rumored to have studied under the last mages of
  Mamrielyon, makes decisions affecting both academic and civic matters from a
  chamber whose walls display real-time images of every district in Kathrula.
- The Council Chambers: A magnificent circular hall where representatives from
  each college and district meet to debate policy. The room features acoustics
  that allow even whispered comments to be heard by all, and a central round
  table carved from a single piece of ancient wood said to detect lies spoken
  across its surface.
- The Faculty Lounge: An elegant space where professors gather to relax, debate,
  and occasionally engage in friendly magical duels in a specially warded arena.
  The lounge contains a collection of comfortable chairs that automatically
  adjust to the preferences of whoever sits in them.
- The Hall of Bladesingers: An order of elven warriors who serve as Kathrula's
  main provider of law, order, and security. Their commander is **Jarsali
  Tiltathana**, a female elf.
- The Student's Guildhall: A sprawling complex where student organizations
  gather, featuring meeting rooms that change size according to need, a grand
  ballroom for social events, and a cafeteria where enchanted utensils serve
  whatever food the diner desires from an apparently endless larder.

# THE OUTER RING

The 'gowns' are encircled by the town that makes Kathrula more than just a
university. Reflecting its elven heritage, culture and nature are prominent
throughout the residential and business districts of the city. Entire
neighbourhoods are suspended in the canopies of small woods in the Village,
while the village third sports workshops grown from flora and fungi.

The Arts are as vital to Kathrula as magic, evinced not only by an entire
district of theatres, galleries and such but also by the striking murals on the
most ordinary of street corners, the buskers who are respected members of
community rather than considered nuisances. The town weaves neighbourhoods in
between parks, blending architecture and horticulture.

## THE CULTURE'S THIRD

The Culture's Third serves as Kathrula's creative heart, where artistic
expression is cultivated with the same reverence other societies might reserve
for religion or commerce. The district is characterized by graceful structures
that seem to grow organically from the landscape, with delicate spires and
arches framing open-air performance spaces. Music flows through the streets at
all hours, sometimes spontaneously harmonizing as musicians respond to one
another across plazas and rooftops.

The layout of this district follows musical rather than geometric principles,
with streets and buildings arranged to create pleasant acoustic effects as one
travels through them. The air carries the mingled scents of incense from
meditation gardens, pigments from artists' studios, and the distinctive aroma of
the special paper used by the district's many bookbinders and publishers.

### NOTABLE LOCATIONS

- The Grand Gallery: A sprawling complex showcasing works from artists across
  the Confederacy and beyond, with rooms that magically adjust their lighting
  and proportions to best display each piece. Curator **Elyndra Silversight**, a
  female elf with synesthetic perception that allows her to "see" music and
  "hear" colors, arranges exhibitions that engage multiple senses
  simultaneously.
- The Resonance Theatre: Where magical acoustics allow performances to be heard
  with perfect clarity from any seat, and enchanted backdrops create immersive
  settings that respond to the emotional tenor of the performance. Director
  **Thaeris Melodyheart**, a male half-elf whose compositions have moved
  audiences to tears of joy and sorrow alike, schedules a diverse program
  ranging from traditional elven symphonies to experimental multi-species
  collaborations.
- The Wordsmith's Library: A repository focusing on literary works rather than
  academic texts, featuring reading rooms where enchanted books project subtle
  illusions to accompany their narratives. Head Librarian **Quill Versefinder**,
  a female gnome whose memory contains thousands of poems, hosts regular
  readings and writing workshops.
- The Sculptor's Grove: An outdoor exhibition space where artists work with
  living materials—shaping trees, encouraging crystals to grow in specific
  patterns, or coaxing stones to flow like liquid before setting them in new
  forms. Master Sculptor **Arden Stoneshaper**, a male firbolg whose works are
  said to capture the essence of their subjects' souls, teaches techniques that
  blend magic with traditional craftsmanship.
- The Celestial Tavern: A gathering place for artists, performers, and their
  admirers, featuring tables and chairs that hover just above the floor and a
  ceiling that displays an ever-changing starscape reflecting the actual night
  sky but enhanced with constellations from elven mythology. Proprietor **Lyra
  Stardancer**, a female tiefling whose family has maintained the establishment
  for seven generations, ensures that conversation flows as freely as the
  renowned elven wines served exclusively here.
- The Harmonium: A temple dedicated to the intersection of magic and music,
  where spellsongs and musical enchantments are studied and performed. High
  Cantor **Melodius Truetone**, a male half-elf capable of casting powerful
  spells through song alone, leads ceremonies that synchronize with the magical
  resonances of Kathrula itself.
- The Dreamweaver's Atelier: A collective workspace for artists exploring the
  boundaries between illusion magic and traditional visual arts, creating pieces
  that not only appear different from various angles but actually change their
  form and content based on the viewer's emotional state. Founder **Ilora
  Visionshaper**, a female elf whose innovations in emotion-responsive
  enchantments revolutionized artistic expression, mentors young artists in
  techniques prohibited at most conventional art academies.

## THE MERCANTILE THIRD

The Mercantile Third blends commerce and craftsmanship in a district where
practical needs are addressed with artistic flair and magical innovation. Unlike
the chaotic marketplaces of many Confederate cities, Kathrula's commercial
district is arranged in fluid patterns meant to encourage wandering and
discovery, with shops grouped by complementary functions rather than strict
categories.

The architecture here features more practical elements than the Culture's Third,
with storefronts designed to display goods to optimal advantage and workshops
engineered for efficiency while maintaining aesthetic appeal. Many buildings
incorporate living elements, with walls formed from specially cultivated trees
and roofs covered in flowering vines that provide natural cooling.

The atmosphere buzzes with creative commerce, infused with the scents of exotic
goods, magical components, and the subtle aromatics released by enchanted
merchandise. Ambient sounds include gentle musical chimes that help customers
navigate between different commercial zones and occasional magical
demonstrations that send sparks or colored smoke drifting above the rooftops.

### NOTABLE LOCATIONS

- Arts & Crafts Emporium: A cooperative marketplace where artisans sell
  handcrafted goods enhanced with minor enchantments, from self-warming winter
  clothing to dishes that keep food at perfect temperature. Guild Representative
  **Thistlewick Nimblefingers**, a male gnome whose intricate clockwork toys are
  prized throughout the Confederacy, allocates space and settles disputes among
  the ever-changing roster of vendors.
- General Goods Exchange: Where everyday necessities are available alongside
  luxury imports, all organized according to a complex but intuitive system that
  guides customers toward items complementing their initial selections.
  Proprietor **Merindel Fairprice**, a female half-elf with an uncanny ability
  to anticipate seasonal demand, ensures that quality and value remain
  consistent despite the diverse inventory.
- Kirastreth's Apothecary: A renowned establishment offering both traditional
  herbal remedies and innovative magical pharmaceuticals, featuring a
  consultation room where ailments are diagnosed through a combination of
  conventional examination and divination magic. Master Herbalist **Kirastreth
  Healinghand**, an elderly elf whose knowledge of medicinal plants spans
  centuries, personally oversees the preparation of the most potent remedies.
- Gemgleam Jewelry: Where master crafters combine precious metals and stones
  with enchantments that enhance beauty, protect the wearer, or serve
  specialized functions like translation or memory enhancement. Head Jeweler
  **Orindil Gemsong**, a male elf whose family has practiced the art for fifteen
  generations, creates pieces that seamlessly blend magical utility with
  aesthetic excellence.
- Felosial's Magic Items: A shop dealing in practical enchanted objects, from
  ever-sharp kitchen knives to self-sorting bookshelves, with a special section
  dedicated to items assisting non-magical individuals in managing magical
  environments. Proprietor **Felosial Spellweave**, a female elf whose
  innovations in sustainable enchantment have earned recognition from the
  College of Enchantment, focuses on creating items that improve daily life
  rather than spectacular but rarely used curiosities.
- The Elemental Forge: Where master smiths utilize controlled elemental energies
  to create metalwork of extraordinary quality and sometimes surprising
  properties. The open workshop allows customers to observe the creation
  process, from conventional forging enhanced by precise magical temperature
  control to the binding of elemental essences within finished pieces. Master
  Smith **Thorgan Firefist**, a male dwarf who left Ka'zakjorn to study magical
  metallurgy, produces tools and weapons that often become family heirlooms.
- Whisperwind Spellcasting Services: A practical magic establishment where
  customers can commission spellcasting for specific needs, from sending
  messages across vast distances to creating personalized illusions for special
  occasions. Chief Caster **Alyra Spellvoice**, a female human whose versatile
  magical abilities compensate for her relatively modest power, manages a staff
  of specialists trained in different schools of magic to address diverse client
  requirements.

## THE VILLAGE THIRD

The Village Third represents Kathrula's residential heart, where homes blend
seamlessly with natural features to create living spaces that honor the city's
elven heritage while accommodating its diverse population. This district
features the most extensive integration of nature and architecture, with entire
neighborhoods constructed within and around massive trees, connected by an
intricate network of bridges, platforms, and occasionally magical conveyances.

Unlike the dense urban housing found in many Confederate cities, dwellings here
are arranged in organic clusters that promote community interaction while
preserving private spaces. Many homes incorporate living plants as structural
elements, with walls formed from guided tree growth and interior features that
adapt to seasonal changes, cooling naturally in summer and providing insulation
during winter.

The atmosphere carries the mingled scents of flowering plants, cooking from
communal kitchens where neighbors often share meals, and the distinctive aroma
of the special resins used to treat living wood against decay. Ambient sounds
include birdsong from the numerous species that share these spaces with humanoid
residents, the gentle creaking of tree homes adjusting to wind, and occasional
musical performances from residents relaxing on their balconies or in common
areas.

### NOTABLE LOCATIONS

- Confederate Guardhouse: A modest but well-maintained facility serving
  primarily administrative functions, as the Bladesingers handle most security
  matters. The building combines Confederate architectural elements with local
  elven influences, creating a symbolic bridge between Kathrula's independent
  traditions and its Confederate membership. Commander **Elric Dutybound**, a
  human male who requested this posting specifically to study Kathrulan magical
  techniques, maintains cordial relations with the Bladesingers while fulfilling
  his minimal peacekeeping responsibilities.
- The Verdant Chalice: A tavern built around the trunk of an enormous oak, with
  seating areas arranged on multiple levels connected by graceful spiral
  staircases. The establishment is known for serving wines and spirits fermented
  with the assistance of carefully controlled nature magic, creating flavors
  impossible to achieve through conventional methods. Proprietor **Thalorin
  Vinebloom**, a male elf whose family has tended the tavern's tree for twelve
  generations, personally selects the musical performers who provide nightly
  entertainment.
- Temple to Niuthün: A healing sanctuary where architectural boundaries between
  interior and exterior blur, allowing patients to benefit from both natural
  healing energies and magical treatments. The structure appears to grow
  directly from a small hill, with walls that can become transparent to admit
  sunlight or opaque to ensure privacy as needed. High Priestess **Elanor
  Gentletouch**, a female elf trained in both divine healing and herbalism,
  coordinates a staff representing diverse healing traditions.
- Magelamp Avenue: A residential street famous for its distinctive illumination
  provided by lanterns containing specially bred fireflies enhanced through
  transmutation magic. The soft, shifting light creates a perpetually twilight
  atmosphere regardless of the actual time of day, making the avenue
  particularly popular with scholars keeping irregular hours. Avenue Keeper
  **Lumina Glowguide**, a female gnome who communicates with the fireflies
  through a secret technique, maintains the delicate ecological balance that
  keeps the insects healthy and luminous.
- Harmony Park: A central green space where carefully cultivated plant specimens
  from across the Confederacy create a series of interconnected
  microenvironments, from tranquil meditation gardens to playgrounds where
  magical flora responds to children's laughter by producing colorful displays.
  Park Warden **Thistlefoot Greenthumb**, a male halfling whose intuitive
  understanding of plant needs borders on magical despite his lack of druidic
  training, ensures that the diverse ecosystem remains in perfect balance.
- The Canopy Commons: An elevated neighborhood built entirely within the
  branches of a grove of massive trees, featuring homes, shops, and community
  spaces connected by bridges and platforms that move with the trees' natural
  swaying rather than fighting against it. The innovative construction provides
  natural cooling in summer and insulation in winter, while magically reinforced
  fibers ensure structural integrity without harming the living trees. District
  Elder **Sylvarwen Highbranch**, a female elf old enough to remember when the
  trees were saplings, mediates the occasional disputes that arise in this
  close-knit community.
- The Folded Street: A residential avenue that exemplifies Kathrula's
  space-bending architecture, appearing impossibly short from outside while
  containing dozens of homes along its actual length. Walking its path gives
  visitors a disorienting experience as perspectives shift in subtle ways,
  though residents navigate it instinctively after becoming attuned to its
  unique spatial properties. Street Maintainer **Vexrin Spacebender**, a male
  tiefling with natural affinity for spatial manipulation, adjusts the street's
  magical parameters to accommodate new construction while preserving its
  fundamental character.
