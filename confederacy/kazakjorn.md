# KA'ZAKJORN

Taking its name from the mountain range under which it is found, Ka'zakjorn is
the largest settlement of dwarves in the Confederacy. The ruling Morigak dynasty
traces its roots back to before the Deracination, though as is the case with
most history of that time, the details of their early days are little known and
much debated. The kingdom is a powerhouse of mineral extraction and manufacture,
sometimes referred to as 'The Crucible of the Confederacy.'

Unlike most cities that sprawl across the surface, Ka'zakjorn delves deep into
the mountains, with multiple levels stacked beneath each other reaching ever
deeper into the earth. While open to outsiders, the city maintains many dwarven
traditions and customs that can be bewildering to first-time visitors. The
deeper one travels into the mountain, the stronger the dwarven cultural
influence becomes, with the Works Level being almost exclusively populated by
dwarves.

The air quality varies dramatically by level, from the fresh mountain breezes of
the Gateway Level to the stuffy, mineral-rich atmosphere of the deepest reaches.
Throughout the city, the rhythmic sounds of hammers striking anvils, picks
chipping at stone, and the low hum of dwarven chants echo through the cavernous
halls. The constant warmth from the forges and natural geothermal vents keeps
the city comfortable despite its mountain setting, a welcome respite from the
harsh climate of the surrounding mountains.

# GATEWAY LEVEL

Being the main point of entry to Ka'zakjorn for most visitors, the mountain
dwarfs have worked hard to make this district as inviting to non-dwarfs as
possible. The district is dominated by the Mountain Gates, a set of 20-foot
doors separating the city from the rest of the Confederacy. Being level with the
surface, the air here is the freshest in all of the city, putting off most
locals from spending too much time here if they can help it.

The Gateway Level serves as Ka'zakjorn's face to the world, designed to impress
and welcome travelers in equal measure. The enormous Mountain Gates are
masterpieces of dwarven craftsmanship, decorated with intricate bas-reliefs
depicting the founding of the city and key moments in its history. When open,
they reveal a grand entrance hall with soaring ceilings supported by massive
stone pillars carved to resemble ancient dwarven heroes.

The streets here are wider than those found deeper in the mountain,
accommodating the wagons and caravans that bring goods from across the
Confederacy. Buildings are proportioned to comfortably house taller races,
though the dwarven aesthetic of solid construction and geometric patterns
remains evident throughout. Markets and trading houses dominate this level,
creating a bustling atmosphere of commerce and cultural exchange.

As with all districts of Ka'zakjorn, the area is illuminated by glowing fungi.
The buildings are made mostly of rock quarried from beneath the mountain, though
the occasional wooden structure can be seen amongst the greys and blacks of the
local stone.

## NOTABLE LOCATIONS

  non-dwarven visitors, run by the multilingual dwarf **Gimla Fireforge**.

# THE RESIDENTIAL LEVEL

The main hub of domestic life in the city where all clan residences can be found
(by those who have access to said clan's tunnels), including the royal palace.
Most of this district is closed off to outsiders, though there is a sub-central
park open to all as well as a few taverns and inns.

The district is a honeycomb of tunnels, some secret and some obvious, and each
decorated with the pictorial history of the corresponding clan. Families that
have inhabited the same tunnels for generations have expanded and personalized
their spaces, creating distinct neighborhoods with unique cultural identities
within the greater whole of Ka'zakjorn.

The Residential Level exists in a state of ordered complexity. Main
thoroughfares are well-marked and accessible to all residents, while clan
tunnels branch off in seemingly random directions, their entrances sometimes
hidden or guarded. The most prestigious clan residences are located closer to
the royal palace, with social standing generally reflected in proximity to the
kingdom's center of power.

Unlike the Gateway Level, the architecture here is scaled for dwarven comfort,
with lower ceilings and narrower passages. Homes are carved directly into the
mountain stone and enhanced with decorative elements - geometric patterns, clan
symbols, and commemorative reliefs. Many dwellings feature hearths that serve
both for warmth and as focal points for family gatherings.

The air carries the scent of stone dust, cooking fires, and the distinctive
fungi that provide both light and food throughout the city. The constant
background hum of dwarven life fills the level - children playing in communal
areas, craftspeople working from home workshops, and the omnipresent sound of
stone being shaped to meet the needs of its residents.

## NOTABLE LOCATIONS

# THE COMMERCIAL LEVEL

The second level beneath the surface is the economic centre of the city. It is a
wide open plaza and series of sprawling marketplaces home to the majority of the
city's businesses. The stuffy air mixes with the smells of beer, exotic spices
from above and below, fried bat and other questionable aromas.

The Commercial Level is a testament to dwarven ingenuity and economic prowess.
The central plaza is a massive cavern supported by thick stone columns carved
with the history of dwarven trade and craftsmanship. Radiating from this hub are
specialized market districts for metalwork, stonecraft, brewing, and imported
goods.

The architecture emphasizes functionality while still maintaining aesthetic
appeal. Shops and stalls are built into the cavern walls or occupy free-standing
structures of stone and metal. Many establishments feature large display windows
illuminated by enchanted crystals to showcase their wares effectively. Forges
and workshops occupy the periphery, where the noise and heat of production won't
interfere with commerce.

The level pulses with activity from early morning until late evening. The sounds
of commerce fill the air - haggling customers, merchants calling out their
wares, the clink of coins changing hands, and occasional demonstrations of
crafts or products. The mingled aromas of the level create a distinctive
atmosphere - the yeasty smell of brewing beer, the metallic tang from smithies,
exotic spices from imported goods, and the ever-popular scent of fried bat
wafting from food stalls.

## NOTABLE LOCATIONS:

# THE WORKS LEVEL

The lowest level of Ka'zakjorn is the beating heart of the city. Home to the
industries and places of education that keep the city going and its occupants
employed. The air is stuffiest here, and blends with the acrid smell of
foundries, tanneries, and other works that to non-dwarf noses can be
overwhelming, but to the locals brings up feelings of honest work and good
craftsmanship.

The Works Level embodies the dwarven philosophy that value comes from labor and
creation. This deepest accessible level of Ka'zakjorn stretches far into the
mountain, an expansive network of mines, forges, workshops, and training
facilities. The massive caverns and tunnels here are reinforced with skilled
stonework and engineering, allowing for industrial activity on a scale
impossible in surface cities.

The architecture prioritizes function over form, though dwarven aesthetics
ensure that even utilitarian structures incorporate elements of beauty. Enormous
ventilation shafts channel air from the surface, and complex water management
systems prevent flooding while providing necessary resources to various
industries. Despite the practical focus, many work areas feature inspirational
murals or sculptures depicting Moradin and legendary craftsdwarves of the past.

Heat permeates the level, radiating from forges, smelters, and the natural
warmth of the deep earth. The cacophony of industry is constant - hammers
striking metal, the rumble of mining carts, the hiss of hot metal being
quenched, and the calls of foremen directing workers. Beneath it all runs a
rhythmic undertone of dwarven work songs, helping teams maintain their pace
through long shifts.

## NOTABLE LOCATIONS

- **The Forge** - All non-commercial metalworks are made in a huge blacksmithing
  compound worked at by members of all clans. The current chief of operations is
  **Brottor Aranore**. This massive facility features dozens of specialized
  forges for different metals and purposes, with separate areas for
  weaponsmithing, armorcraft, and decorative metalwork.
- **The Mines** - A cross-clan mining operation that burrows deep under the
  mountains in search of precious stones, ores, and other subterranean
  treasures. The chief of operations is **Vonana Dankil**. The mines extend far
  beyond the inhabited areas of Ka'zakjorn, with new tunnels being constantly
  expanded as old veins are depleted.
- **Rakankrak Brewery** - Although most clans brew their own beers, it is Clan
  Rakankrak that is renowned both within and outside Ka'zakjorn for an
  impressive range of dwarven ales. Owned by **Whurdred**. The brewery consists

  of warfare. Currently overseen by **Sir Delg Loderr**. The temple includes
  training grounds, tactical planning rooms, and an impressive armory of
  ceremonial and practical weapons.
- **The Underdark Road** - Long road leading to the underdark, allowing for
  exploration and trade with various underdark species, sometimes even duergar
  for their famous firelichen wine. The entrance is heavily guarded and
  controlled, with all traffic carefully monitored by elite warriors of clan
  Stronginthearm.

  its chambers. Features displays of exceptional masonry and architectural
  models.
- **The Foundry** - A specialized facility for casting large metal objects like
  bells, statues, and structural components. The chamber's high ceiling allows
  heat to rise away from workers.
- **The Tannery Quarter** - Situated near a natural underground spring, this
  area houses the leather-working industries, carefully designed with
  ventilation to manage the strong odors produced.
- **The Deep Cistern** - An enormous underground reservoir providing water to
  the entire city. Features sophisticated filtration systems and
  water-distribution infrastructure.
- **The Fungi Farm** - Extensive caverns dedicated to cultivating the various
  mushrooms and fungi that form a significant part of the dwarven diet and
  provide much of the city's illumination.

# THE RESTRICTED DEPTHS

Below the Works Level lie tunnels and caverns not generally accessible to the
public or visitors. These deepest reaches of Ka'zakjorn are shrouded in mystery
and rumor, with access tightly controlled by the crown and select clans. What
little is known suggests these depths contain ancient ruins, experimental
workshops, and defensive fortifications preparing for any threat that might
emerge from below.

The Restricted Depths represent both Ka'zakjorn's greatest secrets and its most
significant vulnerabilities. The kingdom's oldest histories suggest that when
the first dwarves settled the mountain, they discovered extensive pre-existing
tunnels and chambers of unknown origin. Over centuries, these strange spaces
have been incorporated into the city's deepest level, though many remain
unexplored or are sealed by royal decree.

Only those with special authorization can venture into these areas, typically
elite guards, specialized miners, researchers from clan Caebrek, or members of
the royal family. Rumors persist of strange phenomena in the depths - unusual
mineral formations, areas where magic behaves unpredictably, and ancient
mechanisms of inexplicable purpose.

The air here is thick and stale, carrying trace elements not found in the upper
levels. Unusual fungi and crystal formations provide limited illumination,
casting eerie shadows across cavern walls inscribed with symbols that predate
dwarven writing. The ambient sounds of the city fade away, replaced by the
distant drip of water, the occasional rumble of shifting stone, and an
inexplicable low hum that seems to emanate from the mountain itself.
