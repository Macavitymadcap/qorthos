# MŶROCK

The 'crown jewel of the southern Scar' is the ancestral seat of the Mŷrocki
monarchy and the capital of the largest region in the Confederacy. Taking the
entirety of the Mŷrock hill, the city began as an old fortress that has expanded
over the centuries into a sprawling settlement. Its districts radiate outward
from the Mŷrhold, the ancient castle at its heart, where the queen resides when
not attending to royal or confederate business.

Unlike the more egalitarian cities of the Confederacy, Mŷrock displays
pronounced divisions of wealth and status, with distinct neighborhoods for
nobility, merchants, and commoners. This stratification reflects the matriarchal
traditions that have ruled the Queendom for untold generations. Though firmly
part of the Confederacy, Mŷrock maintains its unique cultural identity, with
reverence for tradition, love of pageantry, and fierce loyalty to the Crown.

The architecture reflects the city's evolution through the ages, with the
ancient stonework of the Mŷrhold contrasting against the newer expansions that
form the outer districts. The city is crisscrossed by winding streets punctuated
by elegant town houses, bustling markets, and quiet gardens. The Tevan River
flows along the eastern edge, providing both natural defense and a vital trade
route that has enriched the city for centuries.

# THE MŶRHOLD

Taking the entirety of the Mŷrock hill, the Mŷrhold is an ancient fortress and
houses the monarch when she isn't on royal or confederate business. Made up of
an inner keep and then built upon over the centuries with an outer wall, extra
towers, baileys and other constructs, the castle is a cheek by jowl picture of
how Mŷrish culture has changed over the years.

The Mŷrhold's stone walls bear the weathering of centuries, displaying a
tapestry of architectural styles that chronicle the queendom's history. Within
the inner keep, the royal court conducts the business of state in grand halls
adorned with ancestral portraits and battle tapestries. The Audience Chamber,
where Her Majesty holds court, features a throne carved from a single piece of
white marble veined with gold, said to have been a gift from the dwarves of
Ka'zakjorn in the early days of the Confederacy.

The air within the Mŷrhold is perfumed with incense and polished wood, mingling
with the scent of parchment from the royal libraries and the distant aroma of
kitchens preparing elaborate feasts. The click of courtiers' heels and hushed
conversations echo through the stone corridors, periodically interrupted by the
call of royal heralds or the changing of the Queen's Guard.

## NOTABLE LOCATIONS

  and major state functions are held. The vaulted ceiling is supported by

  noble Mŷrocki houses.

  apartments and offering commanding views of the city and surrounding
  countryside. Access is strictly limited to the royal family and their most
  trusted attendants.

  ceremonial weapons, including the legendary sword Starblade, said to have been

  royal treasures and artifacts are stored, guarded by elite soldiers and
  powerful enchantments.
- **The Royal Gardens** - An array of meticulously maintained gardens within the

  beyond.

# PARKGATE

This is a largely residential district where the richer Mŷrockers live. The
streets are quiet, but filled with restaurants, boutiques and Town houses that,
if it were not for the Mŷrhold overshadowing them, would be classed as grand in
any other town. Aside from the Queen's park from which it derives its name, the
district is also notable for including Sarangela College, the centre of
education in Queendom.

Parkgate embodies the refined elegance of Mŷrocki high society. The district's
wide, tree-lined avenues are meticulously maintained, with flower boxes adorning
the facades of three and four-story townhouses. Lanterns enchanted with
continual flame spells illuminate the streets at night, their soft golden glow
reflecting off polished brass door knockers and window frames.

The air here carries the delicate scent of flowering trees and herbs from
rooftop gardens, occasionally mingling with the aroma of fine cuisine from
exclusive restaurants catering to nobility and wealthy merchants. The gentle
murmur of polite conversation and distant laughter floats through the district,
punctuated by the clip-clop of horses drawing ornate carriages along the
cobblestone streets.

# RIVERSIDE

Nestled along the banks of the Tevan River, Riverside is the commercial heart of
Mŷrock. The district bustles with activity from dawn until dusk as merchants,
craftspeople, and traders conduct business in shops and open-air markets.
Riverside connects the city to the broader Confederate trade network, with
barges and riverboats constantly docking and departing from its busy wharves.

The architecture here is a practical mix of stone and timber buildings,
typically two to three stories high, with shops on the ground floor and
residences above. Many feature covered walkways to shelter pedestrians from
rain, and colorful awnings flutter in the river breeze. The narrow streets wind
and intersect organically, having developed over centuries without formal
planning.

The district pulses with the sounds of commerce and craft - the rhythmic beat of
hammers from metalworkers' shops, the calls of merchants hawking their wares,
the haggling of customers, and the creaking of wagon wheels on cobblestones. The
air carries the mingled scents of fresh bread from bakeries, tanned leather,
spices from foreign lands, and the ever-present briny undertone from the river
itself.

## NOTABLE LOCATIONS

# ROADSIDE SLUMS

Hugging to the sides of Mŷrock's walls are a number of hastily constructed
wooden huts, hovels and shacks made from what little the poor who inhabit them
could find or scavenge. Alleyways and gennels crisscross all over, though ample
space is given on the side of the Confederate Road.

The Roadside Slums stand in stark contrast to the wealth and grandeur of the
inner city. Dwellings here are frequently makeshift affairs, cobbled together
from discarded materials and whatever can be salvaged. Some structures lean
precariously against the city walls, while others cluster together for mutual
support. Despite the apparent chaos, there exists a sense of community among
residents who look out for one another in the face of shared hardship.

The narrow pathways between buildings are often muddy, collecting rainwater and
waste that runs downhill from the more affluent districts. In drier weather,
dust kicks up from the unpaved ground, coating everything in a fine layer of
grime. The air is thick with the smells of close-quartered living, cooking
fires, and inadequate sanitation, yet there are also hints of communal meals and
shared herbs grown in small window boxes.

Despite the challenging conditions, the Slums pulse with a vibrant energy.
Children play improvised games in the narrow spaces between dwellings, musicians
perform for coins at street corners, and neighbors share what little they have.
Many residents work as laborers, servants, or craftspeople in the wealthier
districts, returning to the Slums at day's end.

# SOUTHGATE MARKET

The stink of tanneries, butchers, brewers and all other forms of commerce hits
you as you enter this maze of shops and warehouses. Built around the city's busy
Southgate, the sprawling market is always bustling with hustlers and customers
looking for a bargain.

Southgate Market serves as Mŷrock's industrial and commercial center, where the
practical needs of the city and surrounding region are met. The district is a
labyrinthine complex of workshops, storehouses, and open-air stalls arranged
with little apparent organization. Streets vary from broad thoroughfares near
the gate to narrow alleys that wind between buildings, some so tight that two
people cannot walk abreast.

The cacophony of commerce is constant - hammers striking anvils, saws cutting
wood, merchants calling out their wares, and the general din of hundreds of
conversations happening simultaneously. Animals being led to slaughter add their
voices to the mix, while the clatter of carts and wagons forms a percussive
backdrop. The district's smells are equally varied and intense, from the acrid
tang of the tanneries to the yeasty aroma of breweries, the metallic scent of
smithies, and the savory smells wafting from food stalls.

The buildings here tend toward functionality rather than beauty, with sturdy
stone foundations supporting timber-framed upper stories. Many workshops feature
large windows to admit light and ventilation, while warehouses are solid
structures with small, high windows and sturdy doors. Awnings and canopies in a
riot of colors extend over market stalls, creating a patchwork effect when
viewed from above.

# TEMPLE DISTRICT

The quietest part of town, dominated by Quietstones, a multi-faith graveyard
that has been the final resting place of the royal line, and other notable
citizens of the Queendom's history, for centuries. Birdsong and cool river
breezes abound, and the usually cheek-by-jowl style of city planning in the rest
of town relents here, giving way to open spaces.

The Temple District serves as Mŷrock's spiritual heart, offering respite from
the city's bustle. The atmosphere is one of contemplative tranquility, with
wide, tree-lined paths connecting the various houses of worship. Stone walls and
carefully tended hedgerows separate individual temple grounds, creating secluded
gardens for meditation and prayer.

The architecture here is the most diverse in the city, with each temple
reflecting the aesthetic traditions associated with its deity. Some are soaring
structures of marble and stained glass, others are humble wooden buildings
almost hidden by surrounding gardens, while still others feature unusual designs
that honor their respective deities' domains.

Compared to the rest of Mŷrock, the sounds here are subdued - distant chanting
and hymns from temples, the rustle of prayer scrolls in the breeze, the
occasional toll of ceremonial bells, and the constant background melody of birds
in the many trees. The air carries the scent of incense and candle wax from the
temples, mingled with the fragrance of flowers planted throughout the district's
gardens.
