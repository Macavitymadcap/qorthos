# Waverest

## Rockton

By tunneling deep into the cliff and below the Lord Admiral's men and a
contingent of dwarves exiled from Skün managed to double the area of Waverest
when it experienced its first population boom a few hundred years ago. The
majority of inhabitants are dwarves, with a minority of gnomes, humans and even
myconids living beneath the earth together, trading and working under the glow
of luminescent fungi.

### The Chondronite Bazaar

The shopping plaza and central district of Rockton where many merchants,
lawyers, artisans and others ply their trades in the glow of the luminescent
fungi that hang off the roof of the cavern above. There are buildings made of
the excess stone quarried when the Bazaar was constructed and others have been
carved out of the rock itself up and down, giving the district many tunneling
offshoots that connect to different streets and chambers.\
With major roads leading to the surface the air in the Bazaar is the freshest in
Rockton, the earthy smell of the fungus lighting the district mixing with the
salt breeze of the Wave Road and the country air of the Under Road.

### The Halls of Residence

The main residential district of Rockton, encompassing a large cavern around
which are tunnels running off into the various neighbourhoods of dwarf style
hives of rooms, stacked below each other reaching ever deeper into the earth,
with each designated to different clans.

  **Myconids**, whose ancestors grew the Underpark in collaboration with the
  city, act as wardens.

### Skünish Town

The oldest part of Rockton, Skünish Town is a large cavern hugging the ocean,
the rhythmic beat of waves crashing into the rock walls of the district serving
as a constant reminder, It is the first area of the cliff face to be excavated
by the Skünish contractors, and as such reflects the architectural styles common
to the far southern continent; bold geometric lines; simple motifs carved into
the rock; stone panels locked together forming larger buildings; structures
carved into the rock of the cavern and such.

  ancient Skünish art of Kinesthetic Arguing. It is maintained by **Vagnis

## Talton

The youngest of the three towns, Talton is home to a halfling majority, most of
whom trace their ancestry back to the original Chondothi tribes that migrated
south from the Plains during the war with Zilrikax. While some of the district
reflects their nomadic beginnings, the town displays wealth and grandeur on the
upper west side contrasted with poverty and humility on the lower east side.

### Baen Chondoth

The oldest area of Talton, Baen Chondoth resembles a permanent circus: there are
many large tents, yurts, tipis and other such domiciles that hearken to the way
the Chondothi halflings traditionally lived on the Plains. As such it is a
concentration of Chondothi culture, but with the Confederate Road running
through it to the north it also serves as the gateway to the Confederacy for
many who have made the journey by sea or sky passing through Waverest.\
A jumble of huts, yurts, wooden houses and brick buildings radiate from the town
hexagon, the central meeting place and crossroads of the town. Carts, livestock
merchants and miscreants rattle off a barrage of sounds that reflect off the
various canopies around town, making strange echoes in some corners. The ocean
breeze is drowned out by the scent of chondothi spices and the smoke of sheesha
wafting through the district.

#### Notable Locations

- Alderman’s Yurt: Residence and office of the current Alderman of Talton, the
  halfling **Estrin Willowgate**.

- Yondalla Hearth: chondothi style mega-yurt temple to Yondalla, ran by a
  collective of devout halflings.

### The Greenbelt

Expanding beyond the limits of Talton is a vast sea of farmland either side of
the Confederate Road, which half way down opens up to join the Under Road out of
Rockton. Known as the Greenbelt, the city's abovelight produce is grown out
here. There are a few farming families who between them have monopolised the
area, and a small contingent of traders around the mouth of the Under Road.\
What few buildings there are on the Greenbelt are clustered around the tunnel
opening, forming a small village. The Western side slopes up as a hill, dropping
off to the east giving the land an off kilter feel. The smell of grains and
flowers offers a welcome relief to the grime of the city proper.

#### Notable Locations

  journey to and from Waverest and the rest of the Confederacy. The current

### The Promenade

The most affluent district of Talton, owing to the Skyport and its constant
stream of merchants and travellers bringing fresh money and goods into town. The
Promenade is home to many great shops, taverns and the large homes of the
wealthy merchants who essentially run the district through their Guildhall.\
The architecture is a mix of masonry and wood of many storeys, with fairly wide
streets by Waverest standards. The salty breeze mingles with the musk of
commerce distinguishing the Promenade as the least reeking populated district.
The racket of Wharfton below is merely a murmur overshadowed by the sounds of
business; costermongers yelling out punnet prices; kids announcing the headlines
of the _Gazette_ as they wave copies of it at any who pass; carts (both horse
and the newfangled horseless kind) clattering down the avenues and alleyways
spreading out through the city and other such noise generated by people making
money and making merry.

  blacksmith.

### The Warrens

The poorest district of Talton, the East warrens are a dense network of wooden
slums built one on top of the over and varying from halfling to human size. It
is often seen as the place where those who couldn’t afford the wharfside or the
stone cold prices down below often find a bed. Many of the flats are rented out
by slumlords who charge by the night, forcing a large number to sleep in the
gennels that criss-cross the district.\
The buildings are mostly halfling proportioned wooden terraces that overlap each
other forming narrow gennels that coalesce into a maze, though prominent roads
like Loaf St. are open to the air and sunlight. The smell of people packed
closely together runs strong through the gennels, piss and worse curdling with
each other in your nostrils.

#### Notable Locations

## Wharfton

The oldest of the three towns, Wharfton was founded by a fleet of pirates nearly
four hundred years ago, converting a two mile stretch of rocky beach into a
network of promenades lined with buildings jutting out from the cliff face
nestling the burgeoning town. To accommodate their ships, and to encourage more
to come as traders, a web of staithes, jetties, piers, docks, wharfs permanently
anchored ships and other such waterborne constructions.

### Cliffside

A small stretch of rocky beach that hugs the cliff towering above it is where
the founders of Waverest decided to dock permanently, and much has changed since
then. The beach has been planked over with gangways and roads and the very cliff
itself has been tunnelled into, though the watering hole for which it is named
still stands, serving beverages and gossip to this day. This is the most
affluent and priciest area of Waverest, and also one of the most important
economic centres of the Confederacy.\
Cliffside boasts the only brick or masonry in Wharfton, though with many boats
docked on its outskirts and many of its older buildings are made of wood. The
sea breeze mingles with the waste of the town which filters into the water below
its planks. The crash of waves, screeching of gulls and boasts of wharf side
vendors bounce off the rock face funnelling the sound across the Ostris ocean.

#### Notable Locations

  cloisters devoted to all the Avar of Light, the current Most Illuminated being

  much magic) that buys and sells books curated by bibliophile (and secret

- The Silver Stowage: An indoor market of general goods and some higher price
  items, currently managed by the elderly one-eyed gnome **Felnip
  Shpudeldooper**.
- The Wave’s Rest: Historic inn & tavern from which the city gets its name. The
  current landlord is **Bartemius Ketch**, a human sailor who has long since
  given up seafaring.

### East Staith

This long wharf bustles with Dagmari, Käsi and Regician sailors and immigrants,
and sees the most traffic of the districts of Waverest. Many smaller piers jut
out of the staith offering multiple docks and space for traders and merchants to
hawk their goods.\
The aromas of Dagmari curry, jaloffa bean stew and Regician fish & chips compete
with the ocean to create a cavalcade of olfactory sensation. A blend of the
three culture’s architectural styles melds with the wooden background that
typifies Waverest.

#### Notable Locations

  hostel-come-temple kept by **Tifune**, a human priest.
- The Sub Tower: An inverted tower that reaches into the ocean in which the

### West Staith

This long pier is the quickest route to Bay-Tsao and Skün, and as such hosts
many immigrants and ships from the two countries, the former even boasting a
floating mini-district that juts off from the main staith.\
With less traffic than the East Staith, this is possibly the quietest district
of Waverest above ground, with the sound of the Ostris Ocean loudest here. The
smell of Bay-Tsaon cuisine blends enticingly with the salt of the water below,
and many paper lanterns and dragon motifs can be seen up and down the staith.
The Skünish presence is most felt at the very end of the staith, which is mostly
populated by people from the southern continent.

#### Notable Locations

### The Quays

In between the east and west staiths lies a complex web of jetties, gangplanks,
wharfs and piers known by the locals as the Quays. Buildings overlap, extending
across the walkways below forming the majority of residences in Wharfton. A
multitude of shops, stalls, markets and restaurants line the wharves making this
a commercial centre.\
Wooden buildings and shacks overlap each other, with some smaller businesses
being canopy and netting affairs, rigged to the beams that criss cross the wharf
below. The pier thrums with the sound of traders, customers, thieves and guards
trying to navigate the maze, reducing the sound of the sea to a mere rumble
emanating from below. A strong salty aroma fuses with urban perfumes and the
funk of port city life.

#### Notable Locations
