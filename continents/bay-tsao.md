# BAY-TSAO

Bay-Tsao is the largest landmass of Qor'thos, dominating the majority of the northern hemisphere. From the Vünderax survey we know it is covered with deserts, tundra, forests, huge mountain ranges and sprawling cities, though there is little firsthand knowledge of its terrain. The Jade Throne presides over its dominion in secrecy and is not in the habit of welcoming foreigners. The whole continent is ruled by the God-Emperor, who legend says ascended to god-hood by slaying the Dævar Lords that seized control of the continent in the centuries after the Deracination. Former citizens of the Empire claim it is a rigid society based upon ancestor worship and dark magick, though naturally the few Bay-Tsaon diplomats who grace our shores discredit such reports as insurrectionist propaganda.

Unlike the diverse democracies of the Confederacy or the mercantile Caliphate of Dagmar, Bay-Tsao presents a façade of perfect unity beneath the absolute authority of its God-Emperor. This vast empire stretches from temperate southern provinces through the central heartlands to the frozen northern wastes that have never been successfully mapped by outsiders. What little information escapes its borders suggests a civilization of staggering antiquity and refinement, whose technological and magical achievements may surpass anything found elsewhere in Qor'thos, yet which remains deliberately isolated from foreign influence.

The landscape of Bay-Tsao encompasses almost every possible terrain, from scorching deserts to lush river valleys, from snow-capped mountain ranges to endless steppes, from dense primeval forests to coastal regions where massive port cities conduct strictly regulated foreign trade. This environmental diversity has fostered distinct regional cultures unified through a complex bureaucracy that extends the God-Emperor's authority to the farthest reaches of the continent while allowing limited local autonomy within the confines of imperial doctrine.

The spiritual landscape is equally complex, officially centered on veneration of the God-Emperor who is said to have saved the continent from demonic rule, yet incorporating elements of ancestor worship, nature reverence, and philosophical traditions that predate the current imperial dynasty by millennia. This carefully maintained synthesis provides spiritual foundations for a society where deviation from established norms is swiftly identified and corrected, creating a culture that presents remarkable continuity despite the passage of centuries and the vast geography it encompasses.

# THE ETERNAL CAPITAL

Rising like a dream made manifest from the mist-shrouded waters of the great Lake Tsao, the Eternal Capital stands as the heart of the empire and the seat of the God-Emperor's power. Known to citizens as Tsao Jincheng ("Golden City of Tsao"), this massive urban center has served as the imperial capital for the entire duration of the current dynasty—over a thousand years according to official histories, though scholars debate the accuracy of the earliest records. What cannot be disputed is the city's breathtaking scale and grandeur, visible even to the few foreign visitors permitted within its outermost districts.

Unlike the democratic forums of Confederate cities or the mercantile bustle of Dagmari bazaars, the Eternal Capital embodies perfectly ordered hierarchy, with each district's purpose, architecture, and population strictly defined by imperial decree. The city expands outward from its sacred center in concentric rings, each separated from the next by massive walls patrolled by elite imperial guards. The innermost ring contains the Forbidden Palace where the God-Emperor resides, surrounded by successive rings housing imperial administrators, noble families, merchant guilds, artisan quarters, and finally the outer districts where common laborers dwell.

The architecture throughout the city demonstrates both technical mastery and symbolic significance, with buildings constructed according to precise mathematical principles believed to channel cosmic energy in beneficial patterns. The most impressive structures feature distinctive upturned roofs covered in ceramic tiles glazed in imperial gold, green jade, or deep crimson, with supporting columns and beams elaborately carved with dragons, phoenixes, and other symbolic creatures. Even humble buildings follow strict regulations regarding height, orientation, and decorative elements, creating a cityscape where every structure reinforces the divine order emanating from the imperial center.

The atmosphere in the Eternal Capital engages all senses in a carefully orchestrated experience of imperial grandeur. The air carries the mingled scents of incense burned in countless shrines and temples, exotic spices from kitchen districts preparing regional cuisines from across the empire, and the subtle perfume of flowering trees planted throughout the city according to ancient aesthetic principles. The soundscape blends ceremonial music performed at regular intervals throughout the day, the distinctive chiming of mechanized water clocks marking official time divisions, and the constant background hum of millions of inhabitants moving through their precisely defined roles in the imperial machine.

# THE JADE PROVINCES

Radiating outward from the Eternal Capital, the Jade Provinces form the cultural and economic heartland of the empire, a densely populated region of fertile river valleys, ancient forests carefully maintained for imperial hunts, and cities whose foundations predate even the God-Emperor's ascension. This central zone represents Bay-Tsao at its most refined and regulated, where imperial control functions with near-perfect efficiency and daily life proceeds according to patterns established over centuries of careful optimization.

Unlike the frontier provinces where geographical challenges and distance from the capital create space for limited local variation, the Jade Provinces exhibit remarkable uniformity in governance, cultural practices, and social organization. The imperial bureaucracy maintains a pervasive presence, with officials appointed directly by the central administration rather than drawn from local populations, ensuring decisions reflect imperial priorities rather than regional interests. This administrative consistency creates a landscape where travelers can journey for thousands of miles while encountering essentially identical governmental structures in every settlement.

The physical landscape combines natural features with extensive human modification dating back millennia. Rivers flow in channels straightened and reinforced by ancient engineering projects, forests grow in patterns established by imperial landscapers to maximize both aesthetic beauty and timber production, and agricultural regions follow field arrangements designed by long-dead administrative geometers to optimize irrigation efficiency. This harmonious integration of natural and human elements reflects the imperial philosophy that proper governance brings all aspects of existence into perfect alignment.

Architecture throughout the Jade Provinces follows strict regulations based on both practical considerations and symbolic meanings. Even in smaller settlements, buildings are arranged according to cosmological principles, with important structures oriented along cardinal directions and positioned to channel energy flows believed to promote prosperity and stability.

# THE STEPPES TERRITORIES

Stretching across the empire's western reaches, where forested hills gradually give way to vast grasslands extending toward distant horizons, the Steppes Territories represent a distinctive region where Bay-Tsao's absolute control meets the practical challenges of governing highly mobile populations across enormous distances. This frontier zone bears greater cultural resemblance to neighboring Käs than to the Jade Provinces, though centuries of imperial influence have created a unique hybrid society that combines nomadic traditions with Bay-Tsaon political structures.

Unlike the densely populated heartland provinces with their ancient cities and intensive agriculture, the Steppes Territories feature widely scattered permanent settlements serving primarily as administrative centers and trading posts, surrounded by expansive grasslands where semi-nomadic clans follow traditional migration patterns with their herds of horses, sheep, and distinctive woolly cattle adapted to the harsh continental climate. These nomadic groups maintain their own internal leadership structures and cultural practices while acknowledging imperial authority through formalized tribute relationships and military service obligations.

The physical landscape shapes every aspect of life in these territories—endless rolling plains where summer grasses grow tall enough to hide mounted riders, sheltered valleys providing winter protection from bitter winds sweeping down from the northern mountains, rivers flowing westward through dramatic canyons carved over geological time scales. The climate creates additional challenges, with scorching summers giving way to winters of legendary severity, requiring adaptive strategies that differ dramatically from those appropriate to the more temperate imperial heartlands.

Architecture in the permanent settlements follows simplified versions of imperial styles, adapted to local materials and environmental conditions while maintaining essential symbolic elements demonstrating Bay-Tsaon authority. Outside these administrative centers, traditional dwelling forms predominate—particularly the distinctive round, portable dwellings crafted from felted wool stretched over collapsible wooden frameworks, designed for quick assembly and disassembly as clans follow seasonal migration routes.

# THE FROZEN REACH

Extending northward from the imperial heartlands into territories where winter reigns supreme for most of the year, the Frozen Reach represents the empire's most challenging frontier—a vast expanse of tundra, taiga forest, and ultimately polar ice where human settlement exists in constant negotiation with extraordinarily harsh natural conditions. This remote region serves multiple imperial purposes—source for unique resources unavailable elsewhere, buffer zone protecting more populated territories from northern threats, and proving ground where particularly determined officials demonstrate their capacity to extend imperial order into the most inhospitable environments imaginable.

Unlike the densely administered Jade Provinces or even the semi-autonomous Steppes Territories, the Frozen Reach operates under specialized governance systems acknowledging the practical impossibility of maintaining standard imperial control structures in regions where settlements may be cut off from communication with administrative centers for months during winter storms. Local authorities receive broader discretionary powers than permitted elsewhere, though this operational flexibility exists within a framework of absolute loyalty to imperial principles and regular accountability during the brief summer seasons when travel becomes feasible.

The physical environment dominates every aspect of life in these territories—endless forests of coniferous trees stunted by cold and wind, open tundra where permafrost prevents conventional agriculture but supports specialized plant communities during brief summer thaws, mountains whose peaks remain snow-covered year-round, and ultimately the great ice sheet extending northward beyond all mapped territories. The climate creates challenges unknown in southern regions, with winter temperatures cold enough to freeze unprotected flesh instantly, summer thaws transforming solid ground into impassable bog, and extreme seasonal variations in daylight requiring specialized adaptations in both physical infrastructure and social rhythms.

Architecture throughout the region reflects these environmental imperatives, with settlements featuring compact designs minimizing exterior surface area, thick walls incorporating sophisticated insulation systems, communal heating facilities serving multiple dwellings, and often subterranean components utilizing the earth's relatively stable temperature to moderate living conditions. Building materials differ significantly from those used in southern provinces, with local timber, stone, and even ice and snow serving as primary construction elements, supplemented by specialized imports providing essential components unavailable locally.

# THE FORBIDDEN MOUNTAINS

Rising like a titanic wall between the imperial heartlands and the southeastern coastal regions, the Forbidden Mountains represent both geographical barrier and cultural frontier, where settlements perched on precarious slopes and nestled in hidden valleys maintain traditions significantly divergent from imperial standards despite centuries of nominal inclusion within the empire. This region's extreme vertical topography has historically complicated administrative control, creating spaces where heterodox practices and occasionally outright resistance to imperial authority have found refuge despite regular campaigns to extend standardized governance to every corner of the God-Emperor's domains.

Unlike the relatively accessible landscapes of even the northern territories, the Forbidden Mountains present unique challenges to imperial administration—settlements separated by seemingly impassable gorges requiring days of travel between locations visible across intervening space, vertical territories where climbing skills become essential for basic movement, microclimates shifting dramatically within short distances as elevation changes create entirely different environmental conditions. These geographical realities have historically limited the empire's ability to enforce standard administrative structures, requiring compromise arrangements acknowledging local autonomy within formally recognized submission to imperial authority.

The physical environment creates a landscape of extraordinary diversity compressed into relatively compact geographical space. Lowland valleys feature subtropical conditions supporting agricultural patterns impossible elsewhere in the empire, mid-elevation zones transition through temperate forests into alpine meadows where specialized pastoral economies predominate, and ultimately peaks reach heights where permanent snow and ice create conditions analogous to the Frozen Reach despite southerly latitudes. This environmental diversity supports cultural variation mirroring the landscape—traditions, languages, and social structures differ between valleys sometimes separated by only a few miles of impassable terrain.

Architecture throughout the region reflects both environmental necessities and cultural distinctiveness, with settlements featuring construction techniques optimized for challenging topography—buildings perched on stilts to accommodate steep slopes, structures partially carved into mountainsides to maximize limited flat space, distinctive terracing systems transforming precipitous terrain into productive agricultural land. While imperial symbolic elements appear in administrative centers and religious buildings, local aesthetic traditions maintain stronger expression here than in more thoroughly integrated regions, creating a visual landscape where imperial presence appears more as overlay than foundation in many communities.

# THE IMPERIAL HEARTBEAT

Flowing like a living network through the veins of the empire, the Imperial Heartbeat represents the sophisticated infrastructure and administrative systems that bind Bay-Tsao's vast territories into a cohesive whole. More than simple transportation routes or communication channels, these interconnected networks embody the empire's foundational philosophy that proper governance requires unimpeded flow of resources, information, and authority from the divine center to the furthest periphery, with corresponding return flows enabling central awareness of conditions throughout the imperial body.

Unlike the visible architectural manifestations of imperial power—massive palaces, imposing city walls, monumental temples—the systems comprising the Imperial Heartbeat often operate with deliberate subtlety, their critical functions concealed within seemingly ordinary structures or embedded in natural features modified through generations of careful engineering. This infrastructural network represents the empire's most significant achievement, enabling administrative control over territories so vast that many other civilizations would fragment under the strain of distance and diversity.

The physical components of this system take multiple forms, each optimized for particular functions within the greater whole. The Grand Canal Network extends navigable waterways thousands of miles inland from coastal regions, allowing bulk transportation of goods throughout the empire while providing irrigation supporting intensive agriculture in regions naturally too dry for optimal production. The Imperial Road System connects administrative centers via precisely engineered highways featuring standardized way stations, marker systems, and security protocols ensuring both physical transit and information flow meet exacting imperial specifications. The Signal Relay Network combines conventional visual communications—specialized flags, smoke patterns, lantern configurations—with rumored magical enhancements enabling near-instantaneous transmission of critical information between major administrative centers.

Beyond these material manifestations, the Imperial Heartbeat encompasses administrative systems coordinating all essential imperial functions. The Census and Taxation Bureau maintains extraordinary detailed population records enabling efficient resource extraction while identifying potential social disruptions before they manifest as actual threats. The Imperial Courier Service provides physical document delivery with reliability unmatched elsewhere in Qor'thos, its operations governed by protocols optimized through centuries of refinement.

# THE FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE

Deep beneath the visible structures of imperial governance lies a shadow realm of closely guarded secrets, specialized knowledge, and concealed capabilities known collectively as the Forbidden Knowledge. This term encompasses both tangible assets—ancient artifacts with powers beyond conventional understanding, archives containing historical truths contradicting official narratives, laboratories developing technologies deemed too disruptive for general awareness—and intangible resources including specialized magical techniques, suppressed historical accounts, and strategic capabilities maintained in absolute secrecy to preserve imperial advantage against potential threats both internal and external.

Unlike the empire's public institutions, which operate with ostentatious visibility intended to impress subjects with imperial power and efficiency, the organizations managing Forbidden Knowledge maintain deliberate obscurity, often operating within seemingly conventional structures whose true functions remain invisible to all but specifically authorized personnel. This approach reflects the fundamental understanding that certain forms of knowledge represent potential threats to established order if broadly disseminated, requiring careful containment while simultaneously providing essential advantages to those controlling such resources.

The physical manifestations of this system appear in various forms throughout imperial territories, though always disguised or concealed from general awareness. The Sealed Archives maintain historical records deemed too sensitive for conventional historical repositories, particularly those relating to the God-Emperor's ascension and the true nature of the Dævar Lords whose defeat established the current imperial order. The Hidden Laboratories develop technologies and magical techniques beyond anything publicly acknowledged, their operations conducted in locations either physically isolated from population centers or concealed within seemingly conventional facilities through elaborate security measures. The Containment Vaults house artifacts, entities, and substances too dangerous for conventional management but too valuable or irreplaceable for destruction, maintained under perpetual guardianship by specialists sworn to lifetime service.

Access to different categories of Forbidden Knowledge operates through elaborately layered security protocols, with each level of authorization revealing previously invisible aspects of imperial reality while simultaneously imposing escalating consequences for potential violation of secrecy requirements. Even the highest imperial officials typically access only those aspects of the system directly relevant to their specific responsibilities, with comprehensive awareness reserved exclusively for the God-Emperor himself, who reportedly maintains personal connection to each component through means transcending conventional communication methods.

# THE GOD-EMPEROR'S REALITY

At the center of Bay-Tsao's complex cultural, political, and metaphysical systems stands the singular figure from whom all authority flows and in whom all imperial narratives find their ultimate justification—the God-Emperor himself. Unlike conventional rulers claiming divine right or religious leaders serving as intermediaries to supernatural powers, the God-Emperor occupies a unique ontological position as a being who reportedly began as mortal before achieving divine status through direct confrontation with and defeat of entities of established supernatural power, creating a precedent existing nowhere else in Qor'thos's theological landscape.

Unlike conventional religious figures surrounded by comprehensive theological systems developed over centuries of scholarly elaboration, the God-Emperor's nature remains deliberately ambiguous in certain respects, with official doctrine simultaneously asserting specific historical claims regarding his mortal origins and ascension while maintaining strategic vagueness about the precise mechanisms and metaphysical implications of his transformation. This carefully maintained ambiguity serves multiple purposes, allowing diverse interpretations accommodating regional cultural variations while preventing any single theological perspective from developing independent authority potentially challenging imperial control of religious narrative.

The physical manifestation of the God-Emperor's presence appears primarily through the vast imperial infrastructure itself rather than regular public appearances or broadly distributed imagery. While sculptures, paintings, and other representations exist throughout imperial territories, these works present deliberately stylized depictions emphasizing symbolic attributes rather than individualized portraiture, reinforcing the understanding that the God-Emperor transcends conventional physical limitations. Official doctrine holds that he maintains simultaneous awareness throughout his domains through means transcending normal consciousness, with his attention focusing more intensely on locations or situations of particular significance through mechanisms beyond mortal comprehension.

Access to direct imperial presence represents the empire's most tightly controlled resource, with elaborate protocols governing every aspect of potential interaction. The majority of imperial subjects will complete their lives without ever directly beholding their divine ruler, experiencing his authority exclusively through the administrative systems acting in his name. Progressive layers of imperial bureaucracy filter information moving toward the center while translating directives moving outward, creating a system where the God-Emperor's literal voice may be heard by only a handful of the highest officials while his will manifests through actions of countless individuals throughout the vast imperial apparatus.

## THE DIVINE NARRATIVE

The official history of the God-Emperor's ascension forms the foundation of imperial legitimacy, providing justification for absolute authority while establishing the distinctive theological framework separating Bay-Tsaon spiritual practices from traditions elsewhere in Qor'thos. This narrative combines specific historical claims regarding events occurring in the physical world with metaphysical assertions about their broader significance, creating an integrated framework that simultaneously functions as political history, religious doctrine, and cultural mythology.

According to imperial histories, the period following the Deracination left the lands now comprising Bay-Tsao in chaos, with the sudden withdrawal of divine presence creating a power vacuum quickly filled by malevolent entities—specifically, four Dævar Lords who established brutal dominance over different regions of the continent. These beings, reportedly connected to demonic forces beyond normal mortal comprehension, imposed regimes of extraordinary cruelty, transforming once-prosperous civilizations into domains of perpetual suffering where human populations served primarily as resources for exploitation rather than societies with intrinsic value.

Into this darkness emerged a figure known initially as Tian Zhu, reportedly a scholar-warrior from a minor noble family whose early life demonstrated exceptional capabilities without suggesting his ultimate destiny. Through means never fully explained in public accounts, Tian Zhu developed methods of combating the entrenched Dævar Lords, gradually building both military forces capable of opposing their corrupted armies and personal capabilities transcending normal human limitations. The ensuing conflict reportedly lasted decades, with conventional warfare against the Lords' mortal servants complemented by direct metaphysical confrontations between Tian Zhu and the entities themselves.

The culmination of this struggle reportedly occurred in 193 AD, when Tian Zhu confronted the combined power of all four Dævar Lords in a final battle at a location now occupied by the Forbidden Palace. According to official accounts, this confrontation transcended conventional physical combat, involving metaphysical principles beyond mortal comprehension and fundamentally altering the nature of reality within what would become imperial territories. The outcome—Tian Zhu's complete victory and assumption of the fallen Lords' power—marked not merely the end of their physical dominance but his transformation from exceptional mortal to divine being, establishing the foundation for the imperial system continuing to the present day.

What makes this narrative particularly distinctive within Qor'thos's theological landscape is its reversal of the typical relationship between mortals and supernatural entities. Rather than humans serving divine beings or gods empowering human representatives, the God-Emperor narrative presents mortal capability directly overcoming and subsuming established supernatural power, creating a model where humanity's potential transcends rather than merely accommodates divine order. This perspective provides theological foundation for Bay-Tsao's notorious self-sufficiency and resistance to external influence, while simultaneously justifying absolute obedience to a system representing humanity's highest achievement rather than submission to external divine authority.

## THE IMPERIAL PRESENCE

While the God-Emperor's historical actions provide foundation for imperial legitimacy, his continuing existence as living divine being rather than merely venerated historical figure establishes the distinctive character of Bay-Tsaon governance and social organization. Unlike religious systems elsewhere in Qor'thos that operate primarily through established doctrines and clerical hierarchies interpreting divine will in absence of direct divine presence, Bay-Tsao functions under the perpetual awareness that their ruler continues to exist as conscious entity actively directing imperial affairs through means transcending conventional leadership mechanisms.

The most direct manifestation of imperial presence occurs within the Forbidden Palace, where the God-Emperor reportedly maintains physical form capable of direct interaction with highest-ranking officials permitted into his actual presence. These extraordinarily rare audiences involve elaborate preparatory rituals ensuring participants meet standards of both physical and spiritual purity deemed necessary for proximity to divine embodiment, with protocols governing every aspect of the interaction—from specific body positions to prescribed speech patterns to carefully limited eye contact—developed over centuries to accommodate the unique requirements of communication between mortal and divine consciousnesses.

Beyond these direct interactions, imperial presence manifests through graduated systems of delegation, where authority flows from the divine center through progressively broader administrative structures while maintaining unbroken connection to its source. Officials at each level receive authority from higher positions while bearing personal responsibility for proper implementation of imperial will within their specific domains, creating a system where theoretical omniscience of the God-Emperor translates into practical oversight of every significant aspect of imperial function despite the obvious impossibility of direct divine attention to countless simultaneous activities throughout the vast imperial territories.

For ordinary citizens without direct connection to administrative hierarchies, imperial presence manifests primarily through the elaborate symbolic systems permeating every aspect of daily life. The imperial calendar establishes time-keeping patterns commemorating significant events in the God-Emperor's ascension and reign. Architectural standards incorporate specific proportions and orientations believed to channel divine energy through physical structures. Educational curricula emphasize narratives reinforcing understanding of imperial legitimacy and divine benevolence. Even agricultural practices follow patterns established through imperial directive rather than merely practical consideration, creating a comprehensive system where daily activities at all social levels continuously reinforce awareness of and alignment with divine imperial consciousness.

Perhaps most significant for understanding Bay-Tsaon psychology, imperial doctrine asserts the God-Emperor's continuous awareness of his subjects' actions and even thoughts, creating a society where external surveillance systems receive supernatural reinforcement through belief in divine omniscience. While practical enforcement of imperial standards occurs through conventional mechanisms—from local officials monitoring compliance with regulations to specialized security forces investigating potential subversion—these systems operate within a cultural context where subjects understand themselves as perpetually visible to divine awareness, creating internalized self-regulation supplementing external control mechanisms with extraordinary effectiveness.
