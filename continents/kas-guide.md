# KÄS

Sweeping savannas and grand mountain ranges typify the topography of Käs, the third largest continent of Qor'thos, found far to the east of the Scar. There are many nations, tribes and kingdoms across its land, but they are all unified by subscribing to the Path of the Abandoned, a dystheistic spiritual movement founded after and in response to the Deracination that teaches independence from the divine, personal fulfillment and reverence for the natural world. The largest Käsi settlement is the central city of Mbanusa, and (contended by Lepia) is thought to be the oldest human settlement in all of Qor'thos. There are structures formed from the foothills of the Umkanwa mountains older than the Mamrielyon Empire littered across the city, and it is host to the Grand Siblinghall, a sort of high temple for the Path of the Abandoned.

Unlike the Confederacy with its diverse humanoid populations or Dagmar with its predominantly human culture, Käs is renowned as the ancestral homeland of numerous animalfolk species. Loxodon, tabaxi, leonin, lizardfolk, and many other beast-derived peoples trace their origins to this vast and varied continent, creating societies that blend their innate animal characteristics with sophisticated cultural development. These diverse peoples have formed a complex social tapestry ranging from isolated tribal communities to sprawling urban centers where multiple species coexist in harmonious interdependence.

The landscape of Käs defies simple categorization, encompassing lush rainforests teeming with life in the equatorial regions, vast savannas where herds of wild animals migrate in patterns unchanged for millennia, harsh deserts where specialized adaptations allow for survival in extreme conditions, and mountain ranges whose peaks touch the clouds and whose valleys hide ancient secrets. This environmental diversity has shaped the continent's cultures, with each region developing distinctive traditions, architectural styles, belief systems, and social structures optimized for their particular surroundings.

Despite these variations, the unifying philosophy of the Path of the Abandoned provides a common thread throughout Käsi cultures. Unlike the theistic frameworks dominant elsewhere in Qor'thos, this worldview emerged from the collective trauma of the Deracination, when the gods' departure left mortals seemingly abandoned. Rather than seeking to reestablish divine connections, Käsi peoples developed a perspective celebrating self-determination, natural harmony, and the inherent spiritual value of the material world. This approach emphasizes personal responsibility, community interdependence, and respect for natural cycles without reliance on divine intervention or guidance.

# THE CITY OF PILLARS

Rising from the central plains of Käs like a testament to mortal achievement without divine assistance, Mbanusa stands as the continent's largest and most cosmopolitan urban center. Known as the City of Pillars for its distinctive architecture featuring massive carved columns that support elevated districts and connect multiple levels of the city, Mbanusa serves as both the philosophical heart of the Path of the Abandoned and as a thriving commercial hub connecting the continent's diverse regions.

Unlike the geometrically planned cities of Dagmar or the organically evolved settlements of the Confederacy, Mbanusa follows unique organizational principles derived from natural patterns—spiral growth reminiscent of nautilus shells, branching structures similar to river deltas, and cellular patterns inspired by biological tissues. These natural inspirations create a city that feels simultaneously planned and organic, with districts flowing into one another through gradual transitions rather than abrupt boundaries.

The city's architecture reflects this natural-pattern philosophy while demonstrating extraordinary technological sophistication achieved without reliance on divine assistance or conventional magic. The eponymous pillars—some as wide as small buildings and tall enough to support neighborhoods hundreds of feet above the ground—are engineering marvels carved from living stone, their surfaces depicting the history of Käs through intricate relief sculptures that continue to be expanded by contemporary artists. Suspended between these pillars are neighborhoods connected by networks of bridges, ramps, and occasionally mechanical lifts powered by sophisticated counterweight systems.

The atmosphere in Mbanusa engages all senses in a celebration of material existence central to the Path of the Abandoned philosophy. The air carries the mingled aromas of exotic spices from countless food vendors, incense used in philosophical ceremonies, the earthy scent of the red clay that forms many buildings, and the subtle perfumes of flowering vines that climb the massive pillars. The soundscape blends dozens of languages and dialects, the rhythmic chanting from communal meditation centers, music performed on distinctive Käsi instruments, and occasionally the roars, growls, or calls of animalfolk citizens expressing themselves in their ancestral tongues.

# THE SAVANNA KINGDOMS

Stretching across the vast central plains of Käs, the Savanna Kingdoms represent one of the continent's oldest and most distinctive cultural traditions. Unlike the centralized empires common elsewhere in Qor'thos, these realms operate as confederations of largely autonomous villages and city-states united by shared cultural practices, kinship networks, and mutual defense agreements rather than rigid hierarchical governance. This flexible structure has proven remarkably resilient over centuries, allowing the kingdoms to adapt to changing circumstances without sacrificing their core identities.

The landscape itself shapes every aspect of life in these kingdoms—the endless grasslands dotted with acacia trees, seasonal waterways that transform from dusty depressions to life-giving rivers with the coming of rains, and the massive herds of wild animals that migrate across the plains following ancient patterns. Rather than attempting to fundamentally reshape this environment, the Savanna peoples have developed lifeways that harmonize with these natural cycles, creating settlements and agricultural systems that complement rather than compete with the existing ecosystem.

Architecture in the Savanna Kingdoms follows patterns optimized for the unique environmental conditions of the plains. Traditional structures feature circular designs that minimize wind resistance during seasonal storms, thatched roofs that provide insulation against both heat and occasional cool periods, and elevation systems that protect against seasonal flooding while providing cooling airflow during hot periods. Building materials are primarily local—earth for walls, grass and reeds for roofing, wood for structural supports—though trade with other regions supplements these with specialized materials for particular applications.

The social structure of these kingdoms reflects the Path of the Abandoned's emphasis on community interdependence balanced with individual responsibility. Leadership typically combines hereditary positions that provide cultural continuity with merit-based roles that recognize particular talents and accomplishments. Decision-making processes emphasize consensus-building through extensive consultation, with most communities maintaining council structures where representatives from different social groups—distinguished by age, occupation, lineage, or other factors—must reach agreement on significant matters affecting the collective.

# THE RAINFOREST REALMS

In the equatorial regions of Käs, where consistent rainfall and intense sunlight create conditions for extraordinary biological diversity, the Rainforest Realms represent a distinctive approach to civilization that integrates human habitation within rather than against the dense jungle ecosystem. Unlike many cultures that clear forest to create space for settlement, these societies have developed sophisticated techniques for inhabiting the multiple vertical layers of the rainforest—from the dark forest floor to the middle canopy to the sun-drenched uppermost level where massive trees reach toward the sky.

The landscape itself creates unique challenges and opportunities that have shaped these cultures over millennia. The dense vegetation limits horizontal visibility but creates multiple vertical zones for habitation and resource gathering. The constant moisture accelerates decomposition of conventional building materials but supports rapid growth of carefully selected living plants that can be guided into architectural forms. The abundant rainfall provides water but creates drainage challenges requiring sophisticated management systems. Each of these environmental factors has influenced the distinctive cultural adaptations that characterize the Rainforest Realms.

Architecture in these societies reflects their multidimensional relationship with the forest environment. Many settlements feature minimal ground-level construction, instead concentrating living spaces in the middle and upper canopy levels accessed via sophisticated systems of stairs, ramps, rope bridges, and occasionally pulley-operated lifts. Structures incorporate living trees as foundational elements, with buildings either attached to these natural supports or created through specialized horticultural techniques that guide growing plants into useful forms—walls formed from intertwined branches, roofs created from trained leaf patterns, even furniture grown rather than constructed from harvested materials.

The social structure of the Rainforest Realms exhibits similar complexity, with communities often organized around specialized ecological relationships rather than conventional political hierarchies. Different groups maintain deep knowledge of particular forest resources—medicinal plants, useful insects, specific tree species with valuable properties—creating interdependent networks where specialized expertise must be shared for collective flourishing. This ecological foundation reflects the Path of the Abandoned's emphasis on natural harmony, with social systems modeled after the complex yet balanced relationships observed in the surrounding ecosystem.

# THE MOUNTAIN SANCTUARIES

Where the Umkanwa Range rises dramatically from the central plains of Käs, creating a natural barrier visible from hundreds of miles across the savanna, the Mountain Sanctuaries represent a distinctive cultural adaptation combining physical security with spiritual significance. Unlike the fortress cities common in mountainous regions elsewhere in Qor'thos, these settlements emphasize harmonious integration with the dramatic landscape, viewing the mountains not merely as defensive positions but as embodiments of philosophical principles central to the Path of the Abandoned—endurance, perspective, and the timeless cycling of geological processes.

The landscape itself performs much of the defensive function that elsewhere requires massive constructed fortifications. Natural features—narrow passes easily monitored, sheer cliff faces protecting vulnerable approaches, caves providing shelter during extreme weather—create inherently defensible positions requiring minimal architectural enhancement. This allows the mountain peoples to focus their considerable engineering skills on infrastructure supporting comfortable habitation rather than warfare, resulting in sophisticated systems for water management, vertical transportation, and climate moderation that transform potentially harsh mountain environments into comfortable homes.

Architecture in the Mountain Sanctuaries reflects both practical adaptation to vertical living and philosophical principles derived from the surrounding geology. Structures typically incorporate natural rock formations as foundational elements, with buildings either carved directly into solid stone or constructed using precisely fitted masonry that complements rather than disguises the underlying landscape. The vertical orientation of mountain life creates distinctive settlement patterns, with communities developing along switchback paths that connect different elevational zones rather than the concentric or grid patterns common in flatland cities.

The social structure of these communities similarly reflects their mountainous environment, with an emphasis on self-reliance balanced by recognition of interdependence in challenging conditions. Leadership typically combines practical expertise—knowledge of weather patterns, engineering skill, agricultural specialization—with philosophical depth derived from contemplative traditions particularly strong in these elevated regions. Decision-making emphasizes deliberative processes that consider long-term consequences from multiple perspectives, reflecting the literally and figuratively elevated viewpoint that mountain dwelling provides.

# THE DESERT FELLOWSHIP

Along the northern reaches of Käs, where rainfall diminishes and the landscape transitions from savanna to increasingly arid terrain, the Desert Fellowship represents a cultural adaptation combining practical desert survival techniques with philosophical principles particularly resonant with the Path of the Abandoned. Unlike the nomadic traditions common in other desert regions of Qor'thos, these communities maintain a network of permanent settlements connected by established trade routes, creating a distinctive civilization that thrives in conditions many outsiders consider uninhabitable.

The landscape appears desolate to untrained observers but reveals extraordinary diversity and abundance to those educated in desert ecology. What seems like empty wasteland contains carefully maintained water management systems that harvest sparse rainfall and channel it to maximum effect, specialized cultivation zones where drought-resistant plants provide food, fiber, and medicine, and wildlife habitats supporting species adapted to arid conditions. This intimate knowledge of desert ecosystems reflects the Path of the Abandoned's emphasis on understanding and working with natural systems rather than imposing artificial order.

Architecture in the Desert Fellowship demonstrates sophisticated adaptation to environmental challenges, with structures designed to provide maximum shade during scorching days while releasing stored heat during cold desert nights. Buildings typically feature thick walls of rammed earth or adobe that provide natural insulation, strategically placed small windows that limit heat gain while providing ventilation, interior courtyards that create microclimates of relative coolness, and often subterranean levels that utilize the constant temperature of the earth to moderate living spaces. These practical adaptations are enhanced by aesthetic elements—geometric patterns adorning walls, mosaic work utilizing colorful desert stones, sculptural forms that channel air movement to create natural cooling effects.

The social structure of these communities reflects desert realities where cooperation is essential for survival. Leadership combines practical authority—knowledge of water sources, understanding of weather patterns, expertise in desert navigation—with moral authority derived from demonstrated commitment to collective welfare. Decision-making emphasizes conservation of resources balanced with equitable distribution, creating societies where wasteful consumption is considered both practically foolish and ethically unacceptable. This naturally aligns with the Path of the Abandoned's emphasis on self-reliance within interdependent communities, making these desert settlements particularly pure expressions of the continent's dominant philosophy.
