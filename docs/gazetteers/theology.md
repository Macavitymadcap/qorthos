## Origin of the Deities

### Creation

The world was a dark void, for how long scholars disagree, but all accept that
at some point the Great Mother appeared, heavy with child. When her waters broke
they flowed as the primordial æther, eventually coalescing into the elemental
planes, the very essence of our world. Her children were the Avar, the Gods, and
the Dævar, the Archfey, Demons, Devils and other major supernatural entities
that we know of today. Though they are all her children, the Great Mother
lavished the Avar with more of her essence, and in turn they grew more powerful
than their siblings. She stayed long enough to instruct her children to nurture
what she had left for them, teaching them how to shape and form the primordial
aether with their will. Then she swiftly vanished from our realm, never to be
seen again.

### War of the Gods

Her children matured and, aside from small disagreements, lived in relative
harmony for untold millennia. They propagated, forming the material plane and
others by carving out the primordial æther and populated their new playgrounds
with lands and creatures of their own design. They roamed across their creation,
inspiring the new inhabitants to add to it what they treasured most about
reality. This, however, was often a matter of dispute between the Avar, and
eventually fighting erupted between the sentient races, spurred on by the
whispers of Carbok, Ishtak, Bahexyma, and other Avar of Darkness. Fights turned
into wars, not only between the mortals but also between the Avar and Dævar, as
Lorothai, Niuthün, Orthalius and the other Avar of the Light fought back against
the corruption of the world left in their trust. The resistance was met with
greater force and severity than before, culminating in the death of Solevius at
the hands of Carbok, a feat still not understood as the Avar are thought to be
immortal.

### Deracination

The Avar of the Light reacted furiously, with Rælion leading them into a
ferocious battle in the heart of Sygil. When the fight threatened to topple the
very foundations of the City of Doors, Ohm appeared simultaneously on all
planes, speaking in a voice that sounded like the groaning of the universe
itself. With his incomprehensible words the Avar and some of the more powerful
Dævar were sundered from the world as we know it, each one banished to their own
private plane of existence and incapable of leaving. Scholars have since called
this event the Deracination, and broadly agree that it heralded a new era in the
world. Indeed, the system with which we keep track of the progress of the years,
the Confederate Calendar, refers to events as Before Deracination (BD) and After
Deracination (AD).

### Age of Avatars

For a time there was silence between the mortals and gods. With no way for the
Avar to communicate their will, mortals carried on with their lives. Some tried
to remember how the Gods had instructed them to live and others carried on with
their lives as if they were never part of our world to begin with. Despite
priests and clerics of all faiths trying their hardest to encourage devotion in
the masses, throughout Qor'thos religion dwindled. Churches were abandoned and
some even cast their eyes to the Dævar to fill the supernatural void in their
lives. Then, in 1209AD the first of the avatars appeared when Lumeros the 
servant of Lorothai burst into his lord's temple in Lepia as a searing stream of 
light, instructing mortals to keep the faith.

The Avar had been busying themselves, outfitting their respective cells as they
saw fit, and eventually they stumbled upon a loophole in Ohm's punishment.
Though they themselves could not leave their realms, beings they created could,
and so they made avatars of themselves to make their will known in the world out
of which they had been cast. The Avatars of the Light instituted the practice of
canonising those mortals they found most faithful to their respective Avar as
saints, ultimately allowing them to become avatars themselves. Avatars of
Darkness have reputedly instituted a similar practice, but it is not discussed
openly save for by the Church of Shæroom

## Clergy

When the gods re-established themselves in the mortal realms the churches
reorganised themselves under instruction from the Avatars. Before the
Deracination the gods were worshipped individually, each having their own church
and separate followers. The War changed the competitive nature of the Gods, and
the Avar of the Light decided to band together, so that now their churches are
combined under one banner, and thus the Church of Light was born.

Where the Church's message took hold most of the old temples to individual gods
were converted into polytheistic churches, but as the Confederacy was born it
was decreed that these could now serve municipal functions throughout the
Aligned States. For example, the temples of Niuthün serve as hospitals, churches
of Orthalius are libraries and centres of research, and houses of Pareesha are
brothels. Some choose to hold one deity higher than the others, but all the Avar
of the Light are held in equal admiration by those who embrace the light. The
Cathedral of The Light in Lepia, while once dedicated solely to Lorathai, now
serves as the central administration for the worship of the Avar of the Light
across Qor'thos, though the D'jambarosha in the Dagmari capital of Salesh is
also considered a sacred site to followers of the Light.

Despite the banished Avar sending their avatars into the material plane to
reassure the world of their continued interest in it, the atheism that emerged
after the Deracination mutated into dystheism, and eventually into its own kind
of religion, albeit one based upon a rejection of the Gods. The Path of the
Abandoned preach self-actualisation for all mortals in a world no longer
impacted by deities, and to nurture the splendour of reality that the gods, and
even the Great Mother before them, left it in idleness. The Path originated on
the continent of Käs around 96AD, though it has now spread across Qor'thos to
differing degrees of welcome. In the Confederacy the Path of the Abandoned is
tolerated and accepted, though their followers have been known to come to
disagreements with the more theologically inclined. The Dagmari Empire expressly
outlaws it, and as of this experience certain cultural tensions with Käs, where
it is the state philosophy.

No temples to the Avar of Darkness exist openly in the world, save those
dedicated to Shæroom, for the sea is a cruel mistress and sailors often have
need to ask for her blessing before they traverse the oceans. The other Avar of
Darkness are worshipped by some, though in secret, and as such information on
their practices and organisations is hard to find. It is said that in the
Underdark temples and churches can be found dedicated to the Avar of Darkness,
though those who have come across them are rare, as few who venture into the
depths of the world ever return.

## Gods of our World

The following pages offer an outline of the major Avar that are worshipped
today, and a brief description of each one. The Dævar, while having considerable
influence on the world, are too numerous to note here, and other works are much
better suited to that task. Some omissions have been made, chiefly for editorial
reasons as this work is meant as a brief introduction to the major gods that are
celebrated throughout Qor'thos, and to include all the known Avar would make
this a hefty tome rather than a light pamphlet. The Gods of the various races
have not been included, as many races have not just one god, but entire
pantheons of their own, the ever expanding list of bizarre entities worshipped
by Kuo-toa being perhaps the strangest and most extreme example.

Though founded in the Confederacy, the Church of Light has spread across
Qor'thos, albeit with minor differences due to local flavour. For example, in
Dagmar, Tar'haba Saleen is part of the Church of Light's pantheon, despite the
fact that he elected out of the War of the Gods. The Roamer of Deserts called
the dunes of Dagmar home before the Deracination, and his deep ties to the
region is reflected by the clergy of the Empire including him in their worship.

Little mention has been made of the God-Emperor of Bay-Tsao, for a few good
reasons. While scholars in the Confederacy and it's neighbours have heard
stories of religious practices within the Eternal Empire for over a thousand
years, precise information about their deity is hard to obtain as the Imperial
Palace prides itself on its secrecy. Ambassadors from Bay-Tsao on their few 
visits outside their lands tell all they come across that the God-Emperor was 
a man who in 1067AD ascended to godhood by defeating the Dævar who cruelly 
ruled the land. Upon slaying them, he took on aspects of their divine power, 
and so became a God amongst men. Some, however, question whether the 
God-Emperor is divine at all, and instead nothing but an elaborate hoax 
propagated by the Chibo-Mei dynasty, to keep their family on the Jade Throne 
in perpetuity.

What may cause more alarm than what is left out of this work is perhaps what I
have decided to include. The Great Mother and Ohm, while perhaps not technically
Avar, are listed, as it is agreed by scholars that they are inextricably linked
with the fate of the gods and mortals. I have decided to include the major Avar
of Darkness as well as those of the Light. The Kathrula University Press would
like me to state that they do not encourage or condone the worship of such vile
entities, and neither do I, yet I believe that one should be acquainted with
them lest their avatars lead you astray from the Light. So read on, and may you
be illuminated.

### Bahexyma

The Lady of Corpses is the vile twin of Niuthün. Though from afar she appears to
be a beautiful woman, up close one can see her skin is as white as leprosy and
her lips run crimson with blood. When the war began she swept down to the
battlefields raising the hoards of the undead, bidding them to continue the
fight with a kiss from her cold lips. Necromancers, vampires, undead and other
reprobates who delight in death hold her in reverence. Her avatars are rare, and
appear in the form of decomposing ghouls and other kinds of undead

### Carbok

The Lord of Murder is the hulking and demented twin of Lorothai. He was a
dominant instigator of the war, seducing mortals to his whims and setting them
upon the world in a bloody rampage. He is the only being known to have ever
killed an Avar by murdering Solevius, and continued slaughtering anything he
could get hold of during the war. He is worshiped by murderers, fighters who
turn their noses up at mercy and those who thoroughly enjoy dealing out death
for their own sadistic satisfaction. His avatars are rare, coming in the guise
of hulking brutes with murder in their eyes.

### Crasooñ

The Lord of Storms blew across the surface of Qor'thos and created the first
winds, in turn piquing the interest of his sister Shæroom who responded with the
first waves. It is said that when the seas writhe in turmoil it is both ocean
and air reliving the battles had by the siblings. Though chaotic in nature,
Crasooñ sided with Avar of Light in the war, some suggest merely so he wasn't on
the same side as his sister. He is venerated by the crews of airships and those
who journey through the sky. His avatars are rare, and appear as faintly
humanoid clouds.

### Dakosh

Before the war the Lord of Destruction was already considered a nuisance amongst
the Avar due to his habit of laying to waste their creation out of sheer malice,
but when Carbok murdered Solevius he joined forces with him and began wreaking
havoc across the planes far more terribly. His name is roared by those who love
to smash things, animate or inanimate. His avatars are rare and fearful to
behold in their void black plate mail and hollow eyes.

### Færunda

When Lorothai brought together the Avar of Light against Carbok and his
Darkness, the Mother of Invention created tools, weapons and other items to aid
them in their endeavor. Artisans, engineers, smiths and also Gnomes show
devotion to her, it being held that she once had a romance with their chief
deity Garl Glittergold. Her avatars are common, always carrying their set
squares of solidity and wearing deep blue aprons.

### Great Mother

Little is known of the creator of our world. Though she remained in it long
enough to instruct her children, they did not remember much about her in detail.
It is speculated that she is a being from the Far Realm, and even more wildly
suggested that she may in fact be the Lady of Pain, the imprisoned ruler of
Sygil. She is not widely worshipped, but some mystery cults exist that pray to
her in celebration of life, nature, and creation, both itself and the act
thereof. She has no avatars.

### Green Man

The Lord of Forests is the ultimate champion of woodlands, indeed he is often
hailed as the first Druid, and some believe he may have invented their language.
He did not take part in the war, instead he wept for the loss of his green and
verdant lands at the hands of his siblings and secluded himself in the few that
remained until the Deracination. He is revered by rangers, druids, gardeners,
farmers and those who live in harmony with the woods. His avatars are common,
though shy of mortals unless they have need of them. They appear as tree-like
humanoids, with skin made of bark and eyes of moss.

### Heria

When Solevius fell, the Lady of the Hunt picked up her bow and helped Lorothai
track down Carbok to exact justice. She watches over both predator and prey, as
the hunt helps sustain all life, regardless of one's role in it. She is
worshipped by hunters, rangers, barbarians and those who love the thrill of the
chase. Her avatars are common, and come in the guise of sleek humanoids armed
with bows of golden yew.

### Ishtak

When Carbok began planting the seeds of the war, the Lord of Domination was at
his side bending mortals to his will. When the fighting began he was the supreme
commander of the forces of Darkness, planning battles and executing them with
merciless skill. He is venerated by tyrants, and those who delight in asserting
dominance over others. His avatars are rare, appearing to those who are easily
swayed as beautiful humanoids with cruel smiles.

### Jadow

Before the war the Lord of Earth was rarely seen, spending most of his time
beneath the ground, admiring it in all its geological wonder. When the fighting
began he sensed the threat to his pride and joy and joined the Avar of Light,
commanding the mountains and hills across Qor'thos to rise as a misdirect and
blockade to the forces of Darkness. He is praised by farmers, miners and many
dwarfs, as Jadow is a brother to their chief god Moradin. His avatars are
common, and appear to be made of the earth itself with glittering gemstone eyes.

### Kæla

The Lady of Deceit is the twin sister of Talia, and the two despise each other.
They grew up playing tricks on each other, and while Talia was able to laugh it
off and remain good natured, Kæla took it to heart, wherein it froze as
paranoia, hatred, and malice. Her name is whispered by spies, charlatans, and
those who play games with others for no positive purpose. The number of her
avatars is hard to gauge, as due to her very nature they appear in many guises.

### Lorothai

The Lord of Light was the second of the Great Mother's children, entering this
world just after Solevius and mere seconds before his twin Carbok. Upon his
arrival he decided to illuminate the world so that his siblings could better see
its wonders. He is the Champion of Light, and declared he would spread it across
Qor'thos and its associated planes to combat the Darkness when the war began. He
is venerated by many peoples, and his avatars appear as angelic humanoids aglow
with radiant energy.

### Niuthün

When Lamara, the Archfey was slain by the hand of Shæroom The Lady of Vitality
reached into her own heart and with that energy raised her back to life. When
war took hold of the Avar she aided the forces of Light by healing any that she
could. When her knowledge could not revive Solevius it is said she wept a
healing balm that is found locked inside some rare magickal plants and fungi to
this very day. Doctors, apothecaries, and those inclined to preserve and restore
life whenever possible are devoted to her cause. Her avatars appear as creatures
of supreme elegance that radiate empathy.

### Ohm

Little is known of Ohm. It is commonly agreed that he is a being from the very
edges of the Far Realm, though no real evidence exists to support this claim.
Despite the fact that he only ever appeared in our world when he instigated the
Deracination, he was known to the Avar and Dævar long before as a whisper of ill
omen and immense power. He is not widely worshipped, though some mystery cults
exist that extoll his lesson of the separation of the divine and mundane. He has
no avatars. The Father of Magick pulled at the bonds of the primordial æther and
discovered the arcane force that held it together. He used his newfound
knowledge to aid the Avar of Light against the forces of Darkness. He is
worshipped by mages, alchemists, sorcerers and anyone who meddles with magick.
His Avatars are common, and appear as slender humanoids wearing rainbow robes
and buzzing with arcane energy.

### Pareesha

The All-Lover beheld all the creatures and saw within each one something to be
adored, as they themselves were a reflection of all creatures of all sexes and
genders. They delighted in matchmaking between mortals, trying to find a fit for
each being where they could, or in the very least bringing their desires to
fruition. When the war came they sided with the Light, seeing the Darkness as
the antithesis of love. They are worshipped by artists, prostitutes, and also
many elves, whose patron god Corellon Larethian is similarly hermaphroditic.
Their avatars are common, coming in the form of humanoids of insurmountable
beauty and indeterminate sex. Pareesha's genderless nature is accepted by the
Confederate and Dagmari churches, though in Regicia they are worshipped as a
female, as homosexuality and gender disconformity are severe offenses within the
isles.

### Rælion

The Lord of Battle delighted in noble fights pitting might against might long
before the war, but when Lorothai commanded his siblings to attack the Darkness
Rælion came into his own commanding the armies of Light. His name is cried by
soldiers, fighters, and anyone who relishes a good, clean fight. His avatars are
common and appear as fierce humanoids in gleaming angelic plate armour.

### Shæroom

Early in her life the Lady of the Waves used her power to drown Lamara, a
princes of the Seelie Court, when a mortal man dared to name her the most
beautiful of all beings and not Shæroom. It is speculated that it was this that
prompted her brother Crasooñ to blow the first winds across Qor'thos, therefore
sparking their rivalry, but no evidence exists to corroborate this claim. In the
war she sided with the Darkness, bringing to a watery demise anyone who apposed
her. She is revered by sailors, fishermen, and all those who take to the ocean.
She is unique, being the only Avar of Darkness whose worship is open in the
world, as all, whether for good or ill, must make use of her domain. Her avatars
are common on the coasts and in the watery deeps of the world, appearing as
humanoids resembling fish in subtle ways.

### Ta'harba Saleen

The Roamer of Deserts chose no side in the War of The Avar, instead merely
continuing with what he had done since the Great Mother bore him: wandering and
changing like the sand dunes which he loved most, preaching that in the
seemingly barren landscape there was life to be revered. He is worshipped by
travelers, peoples who live in deserts, the nomadic Chondothi halflings, and
those who adore the bleak beauty of sand. His avatars assume the guise of
hermits with eyes that glow like a sunset scattering its light across vast
dunes.

### Talia

The Lady of Laughter had both a penchant for song and voracious wit from birth,
often exercising her talents on her twin Kæla. When the war broke out she sided
with the Light, it is often said, because Ishtak could not take a joke. She used
his deficiency to their advantage, creating cunning ruses to thwart the
machinations of the Darkness. She is revered by singers, jesters, and good
natured rascals and rapscallions. Her avatars are common, and can often be
identified by their unearthly voices.

### Zarron

The Lord of Flame bathed in the primordial fires and soaked up their heat to
share with all, whether they wanted to be lit or not. He fought bitterly with
Jadow and in the process created the volcanoes that rage in the waters off the
coast of Pa'rakhan During the war he sided with the Darkness, raining hellfire
upon the forces of Light. Pyromaniacs of all varieties hold him in adoration.
His avatars are few, and they appear as humanoids lit by an eerie fire.
