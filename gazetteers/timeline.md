# Comprehensive Timeline of Qor'thos

## Ancient Times (Pre-Deracination)

- **?BD**: The Great Mother enters this corner of the multiverse and gives birth to the Avar and Dævar. Once they are mature, she disappears, leaving them to shape reality as they see fit, pulling in creatures and beings from other planes and creating some of their own to populate the world they have created as their playground.

- **~2000BD**: The disagreements between the Avar become full-on war. Mamrielos becomes the first theater of war with armies forming on both sides trying to claim the empire for Light or Darkness.

- **1462BD**: Carbok slays Solevius, and his blood spills upon Qor'thos. Part of this blood falls on what is now the D'jambarosha in Salesh, the capital of Dagmar, making it a major pilgrimage site.

- **739BD**: Mamrielos breaks into a thousand pieces as the Avar of Darkness release The Screaming One, the first of the Dævar, into the world. What became of this creature is unknown, but the devastation it caused is still visible in the smoking ruins of the once mighty lands of the God's loved Elven empire.

- **~500BD**: The war reaches new heights of destruction, threatening to unmake the world itself.

- **0BD/0AD**: The war brings the world to the brink of utter destruction, and at the final hour the great Ohm appears from out of nowhere, intoning a solemn chant that deracinates the Avar, leaving Qor'thos free from Gods and their battles, but still ruined by their wars.
