<h2>Qor'thos</h2>
<h3>Ancient Times</h3>
<p>
    The lands we call Qor'thos (old Mamrielyon which roughly translates as 'placenta
    remnants') were formed by the Avar out of the primordial æther, leftover from
    their birth by the Great Mother. When exactly this happened is difficult to
    determine. The War of the Gods and their subsequent Deracination fundamentally
    altered the geological makeup of the world, making surveys, both mundane and
    magickal, unreliable. Based on theological evidence we can estimate that the
    world is at least 400,000 years old, though it is probably much older.
</p>

<p>
    Before the Deracination, the continents were not lain out as they are today. One
    can deduce from looking at any map of Qor'thos that the landmasses comprising it
    were once joined together. The peoples that populated this supercontinent were
    united and also set against each other by direct contact with the divine, and
    little is known about the cultures and kingdoms they created, save for the old
    elven empire of Mamrielyon, which has left but a few traces.
</p>
<p>
    The great diversity of humanoids across the Scar and its relation to the other
    continents, suggests that it was the centre of this supercontinent. It is
    probable that some time before the Deracination some races emigrated into the
    centre, possibly due to divine influence. We know, for example, that the elves
    originated in Mamrielos, that there have been Dwarves on Skün for untold
    generations and that the Gnomes trace their roots back Bay-Tsao, whereas the
    communities of these races found on the Scar are relatively young.
</p>
<p>
    In the final throes of the War of the Gods, the lands were sundered, splitting
    into the shapes we now recognise, indeed the Scar bears its name as a homage to
    this event. When Ohm appeared he severed the link between the Avar and the prime
    material plane, setting Qor'thos in its place, free from direct divine
    interference, as we know it now.
</p>
<h3>Today</h3>
<p>
    The exact layout of the world is known thanks to the Great Cartographic
    Expedition undertaken by Kathrula University in association with Vünderax, the
    dragon ruler of Pa'rakhan in 9386AD. Aided by the flight of Vünderax, scholars
    upon his back were able to see and record accurately the shape of Qor'thos. The
    distribution of races across the world and its natural history is still largely
    mysterious, due to the secretive nature of nations like Bay-Tsao, the ill-omens
    that surround Junderoth and many other factors.
</p>
<p>
    Qor'thos is capped to the north and the south poles with icy tundra, stretching
    out for miles until it melts away into ocean in the southern hemisphere and
    joins up with the continent of Bay-Tsao in the north. Little is known of these
    gelid expanses, as Bay-Tsao does not share anything about the end of its
    borders. Indeed, they deny that there is even an end to them, and claim
    sovereignty over the north pole, though there is little to suggest that they
    have colonised any of it. Some of the the southern polar cap has been explored
    and mapped by some brave Regician and Skünish sailors, but for the most part
    they report it is inhospitable. It would be safe to assume the same for the
    north.
</p>
<p>
    There are many small islands scattered across Qor'thos, but the major land
    masses are: Bay-Tsao, Junderoth, Käs, Mamrielos, Regicia, Skün and the Scar. The
    western peninsula of the last of these comprises the Allied Dominions of the
    Confederacy, which I believe most of the readers of this monograph will call
    home. As this should be the most familiar corner of Qor'thos, let us turn to it
    first.
</p>
<h2>The Confederacy</h2>
<h3>Foundation</h3>
<p>
    The lands we know as the Confederacy were once a collection of disparate
    cultures and kingdoms, some warring amongst themselves, others living in
    secluded communities, or playing multiple sides of a war to their own profit.
    This state of affairs carried on until 6704AD, when an evil emerged that posed a
    calamitous threat to all the nations of the Scar: Zilrikax, an Illithid of the
    Underdark who had achieved lichdom, arose from the deeps to spread terror and
    death across the world.
</p>
<p>
    His armies of demons and the undead swept throughout the lands of the Scar,
    starting with the Chondothi Plains. In 6712AD Zilrikax decimated the land,
    leaving what were once verdant grasslands as twisted desert. This forced out the
    Halflings who had traditionally roamed the plains southwest. The orcish and
    goblinoid races that had also claimed the plains were ensorcelled by Zilrikax's
    magick, adding to the already extensive selection of ammunition and fodder at
    his disposal.
</p>
<p>
    Meanwhile, a group calling themselves the Children of the Scar rallied the
    leaders of the various nations to unite as one to defeat Zilrikax. They met at
    Griselden, the ancestral home of their leader, the warrior Drelpan. As
    Griselden's lands border what was once the Chondothi Plains, they were the first
    to witness the exodus of the Halflings. The horrific tales they told of
    Zilrikax's destruction was enough to convince them of his evil intent and so the
    Accord of the Allied Dominions was signed, forming what we know today as the
    Confederacy.
</p>
<h3>War &amp; Victory</h3>
<p>
    From the outset, the Confederacy was formed to fight Zilrikax, and so all
    members of it were required to contribute men and women to create a combined
    Confederate army. They fought across what were once the Chondothi Plains, now
    known as the Wastes, experiencing small victories only to be undermined by
    staggering defeats. During this time the Dagmari Empire allied itself with the
    Confederacy, though offering only men and aid while refusing to give up its
    sovereignty by joining the fledgling Confederacy.
</p>
<p>
    In 6766AD, Zilrikax was cornered at Silver Tears Falls in the northlands between
    Kathrula and Griselden. Through a ritual performed by Astratis, a priest of
    Lorothai who served the Children of the Scar, the Illithid was banished
    forevermore from Qor'thos, being set adrift in the nether regions of the Far
    Realm. With this, and the suppression of Zilrikax's remaining forces, peace was
    finally secured.
</p>
<h3>Politics</h3>
<p>
    With victory obtained, the Accord of the Allied Dominions was no longer
    necessary, and yet the political structure of the Confederacy clung to the land.
    Historians of a romantic bent tell that the bonds created between the peoples of
    the various nations during the war with Zilrikax proved too deep to undo. More
    cynical scholars, however, point out that the socio-economic benefits of
    confederation were too great to simply shred up the Accord. Whatever the cause,
    the Confederacy became a nation formed of conglomeration, officially recognised
    as joining the world stage in 6781AD with the declaration of Griselden as the
    Confederate capital.
</p>
<h3>Statutes</h3>
<p>
    The Confederacy is just that: a collection of states, cities, kingdoms and other
    such political structures combined to create a greater whole. Each member is
    fairly autonomous, allowed to govern itself as it sees fit, provided they adhere
    to the Confederate Statutes. These are a collection of laws to which the Allied
    Domains have agreed to follow. They are numerous, though, chief amongst them
    being:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Free passage of all Confederate citizens around the Allied Dominions
    </li>
    <li>
        Tolerance of all cultures and practices of the peoples of the Confederacy and
        beyond, except in the worship of the Avar of Darkness (excluding, of course,
        Shæroom).
    </li>
    <li>
        The requirement of every town and city to provide a Confederate Outpost
        stationed with Confederate Guard, to defend the people and provide law and
        order.
    </li>
    <li>
        Recognition of the Confederate Statute of Personhood, which grants rights of
        citizenship and protection under the law to all sentient creatures not created
        by Avar of Darkness. There are many caveats to this particular statute: e.g.,
        orcs can be considered persons despite Gruumsh (the deity that created them)
        having sided with the Darkness, as it has been demonstrated that orcs and half
        orcs raised outside of their tribes have free will.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Major Settlements</h3>
<p>
    The entries below offer a brief outline of the major settlements and states of
    the Confederacy. There are many more places in our land that cannot be mentioned
    due to the confines of space, therefore only the largest contributors to the
    commerce, culture, and politics of the Confederacy have been included.
</p>
<h4>Bizzynook</h4>
<p>
    Situated in the foothills of the Ka'zakjorn mountains, Bizzynook is a small city
    state home to the majority of gnomes in the Confederacy. An absolute democracy,
    all residents are welcomed to participate in Assembly, a debate held every
    Shamra where laws, legal proceedings and even cultural judgements are passed by
    the establishment of two-thirds majority rulings. It is renowned across the
    world as a centre of technological marvels and home to the Bizzynook Institute
    of Technomancy.</p>
<h4>Chak'thron</h4>
<p>A kingdom of dwarfs situated in the Chak'daros hills to the north of the
    Confederacy, Though smaller and younger than Ka'zakjorn to the west, the dwarves
    of Chakthron are a proud people and make up for their kingdom's small stature
    through their offerings to the world. The most notable is it being home to the
    headquarters of Gochsbarg &amp; Rungehyr, the largest law firm in the Confederacy
    who have offices in every major city.
</p>
<h4>Griselden</h4>
<p>
    The most northerly settlement of the Confederacy looking out onto the Chondothi
    wastes, Griselden is a sprawling castle-come-city that was once the ancestral
    seat of the Griselden dynasty. Family records show that it started as a small
    castle, and over the centuries was added to so much that it became a fortified
    city. It is now most notable as the Confederate capital. Delegates from every
    major settlement can be found here making the decisions that govern our land.
</p>
<h4>Kathrula</h4>
<p>
    East of the Chak'daros hills lies one of the few remaining relics of the
    pre-deracination Mamrielyon Empire, Kathrula. The city is built around the
    ancient university, which is regarded as one of the leading centres of research,
    both arcane and mundane, in all of Qor'thos. Though the 'gowns' are a mixture of
    all races, the majority of the 'towns' are elves, most of whom can trace their
    ancestry back to old Mamrielos. The city is the only Magocracy in the
    Confederacy, being ruled by the Arch-Chancellor of the University.
</p>
<h4>Ka'zakjorn</h4>
<p>
    Taking its name from the mountain range under which it is found, Ka'zakjorn is
    the largest settlement of dwarves in the Confederacy. The ruling Torheim dynasty
    traces its roots back to before the Deracination, though as is the case with
    most history of that time the details of their early days is little known and
    much debated. The kingdom is a powerhouse of mineral extraction and manufacture,
    sometimes referred to as 'The crucible of the Confederacy'.
</p>
<h4>Lepia</h4>
<p>
    Situated on the western coast Lepia is a major port, though it is mostly known
    as the holiest city of the Confederacy, the Cathedral of Light found in its old
    town being the centre of the Confederate Church. All faiths are worshipped in
    the city limits, even those dedicated to some of the more agreeable Avar of
    Darkness and the godless Path of the Abandoned. The city and its environs is a
    Theocracy, with the head of each faith having some say in governance, though
    ultimately ruled by the Most Holy of the Cathedral of Light.
</p>
<h4>Mŷrock</h4>
<p>
    The Queendom of Mŷrock covers the largest area of the Confederacy,
    administrating the majority of the southern tip of the Scar. As a matriarchal
    monarchy, the lords and ladies of the noble houses that rule over the Queendom's
    baronies and estates all swear allegiance to Her Majesty, whose ancestral seat
    is in the titular capital on the banks of the river Tevan south of the the
    Tevendar Forrest. Why the crown is always passed to the eldest daughter, rather
    than the eldest son as in most of the world's monarchies, is a mystery lost to
    the ages. Regardless, Mŷrockers are fiercely loyal to Her Majesty and treasure
    their traditions.
</p>
<h4>Pa'rakhan</h4>
<p>
    Dominated by the volcano Wharanitoto at its heart, the island of Pa'rakhan south
    of Waverest is the most unique landscape of the Confederacy. Magma pools and
    volcanic springs adorn the island, and bring it warmth despite its southerly
    latitude. Pa'rakhan is home to most of the dragonborn of the Confederacy, and is
    ruled by the Vünderax, the ancient silver dragon, who settled his kind there
    some time after the Deracination. The main city of the isle, with which it
    shares its name, is built around the base of Wharanitoto, and is the envy of
    Bizzynook and Ka'zakjorn for its ingenious use of volcanic activity to generate
    power for its citizens.</p>
<h4>Tevendar Forrest</h4>
<p>
    A vast wilderness that covers a large section of the central Confederacy, the
    Tevandar forest is an ancient woodland, said to have been home to the Greenman
    himself in the days before the Deracination. It is protected by the Circle of
    Tevendar, an association of druids, rangers, and other inhabitants of the forest
    who vow to keep the land green and unspoilt by industry and man's destructive
    nature. There are many tribes and villages located within its woods, though
    precise locations and populations are hard to gauge, as the circle mostly keeps
    to itself and rarely interacts with the Confederate Assembly unless necessary.
</p>
<h4>Waverest</h4>
<p>
    Founded over five centuries ago by Regician sailors who wished to be free of
    their Kingdom's oppressive nature, Waverest is a large city on the southwest tip
    of the Scar. One of the largest cities of the Confederacy it is often called
    'the Three Towns' due to the nature of its layout. Wharfton, the oldest party of
    the city, is built into the rock face and is a network of wharfs, docks and
    semi-permanently harboured ships. Rockton came next, built into the cliffs which
    enclose Waverest by a clan cast out of Ka'zakjorn. The newest borough of the
    city, Talton, was formed at the top of the cliff by Chondothi refugees during
    the war with Zilrikax. The great elevator that hugs the cliff-face is an
    archano-steam contraption that allows residents access to the town above and
    below.
</p>
<h2>The Rest of the World</h2>
<p>
    Qor'thos is bigger than just the Confederacy, though the limits of space and
    interest inhibit me from writing in greater detail about those lands that lie
    outside our borders. There are many small island nations, dominions and kingdoms
    on this sphere too numerous to mention, so the last segment of this monograph
    will consider the largest players on the world stage, though sadly at a glance
    only.
</p>
<h3>Bay-Tsao</h3>
<p>
    Bay-Tsao is the largest landmass of Qor'thos, dominating the majority of the
    northern hemisphere. From the Vünderax survey we know it is covered with
    deserts, tundra, forests, huge mountain ranges and sprawling cities, though
    there is little firsthand knowledge of its terrain. The Jade Throne presides
    over its dominion in secrecy and is not in the habit of welcoming foreigners.
    The whole continent is ruled by the God-Emperor, who legend says ascended to
    god-hood by slaying the Dævar Lords that seized control of the continent in the
    centuries after the Deracination. Former citizens of the Empire claim it is a
    rigid society based upon ancestor worship and dark magick, though naturally the
    few Bay-Tsaon diplomats who grace our shores discredit such reports as
    insurrectionist propaganda.
</p>
<h3>Dagmar</h3>
<p>
    Across the Chondothi wastes lie the desert realms of the Dagmari Empire, home to
    bejeweled cities, sparkling oases and a mercantile culture which has seen the
    Empire establish trade-routes all across the globe, even into Bay-Tsao. The
    capital Salesh is a city of wonders, adorned in gold and gems that reflect the
    equatorial sun, and is the location of the D'jambarosha, a site revered to
    followers of the Light as the place where fell the blood of Solevius. It is
    second only to the Cathedral of Light in Lepia as a place of holy pilgrimage.
</p>
<h3>Junderoth</h3>
<p>
    Mystery and vast rainforests cover this large island west of the Scar. Few
    explorers return from it, though those who do bring back incredible
    pre-deracination artifacts and potent herbs, and tell of an alien, humid land
    filled with toxic plants and dangerous beasts. Despite this (or maybe because of
    it) many powers in Qor'thos wish to push into the interior and take advantage of
    the continent's resources. The empires of Dagmar and Bay-Tsao have colonial
    outposts there, so too does the Confederacy in the guise of Port Walen on the
    continent's east coast, built and maintained predominately by prisoners of the
    Confederacy who elected transportation over other punishments.
</p>
<h3>Käs</h3>
<p>
    Sweeping savannas and grand mountain ranges typify the topography of Käs, the
    third largest continent of Qor'thos, found far to the east of the Scar. There
    are many nations, tribes and kingdoms across its land, but they are all unified
    by subscribing to the Path of the Abandoned, a dystheistic spiritual movement
    founded after and in response to the Deracination that teaches independence from
    the divine, personal fulfillment and reverence for the natural world. The
    largest Käsi settlement is the central city of Mbanusa, and (contended by Lepia)
    is thought to be the oldest human settlement in all of Qor'thos. There are
    structures formed from the foothills of the Umkanwa mountains older than then
    Mamrielyon Empire littered across the city, and it is host to the Grand
    Siblinghall, a sort of high temple for the Path of the Abandoned.
</p>
<h3>Mamrielos</h3>
<p>
    Mamrielos was home to an ancient elven empire that before the War of the Gods
    ruled most of Qor'thos, and was subsequently devastated by the conflict. Lying
    south of Käs, what was once thought to be a vast continent is now an assembly of
    islands. Most are inhospitable, still bearing the divine scars inflicted upon
    them many centuries ago. Those few isles that are capable of supporting life are
    populated almost entirely by elves, chief amongst these being Bæn Mamriel, a
    nation built upon the premise of trying to recapture the heights of the
    Mamrielyon Empire.
</p>
<h3>The Regician Isles</h3>
<p>
    A dense archipelago just east of the Confederacy, the Regician Isles are a
    network of small holdings, baronies and duchies that all swear fealty to
    Regicia, its central island, and its King. A land of castles and knights-errant,
    the Isles are a place where duty, social standing and tradition are paramount,
    some would say to the point of stifling individuality. Many Regicians have
    sought refuge in the Confederacy escaping a rigid feudal hierarchy that severely
    punishes non-conformists. That being said, the isles have produced some of the
    finest mages in Qor'thos history, and those who have traveled the archipelago
    agree it is endowed with natural beauty and charming, if somewhat stiff, people.
</p>
<h3>Skün</h3>
<p>
    West of the scar and the most southerly landmass before reaching the pole, Skün
    is a frosty and mountainous continent home to the largest concentration of
    dwarves in Qor'thos. Dwarves and the few non-dwarves there mostly live well
    below ground where geological activity makes for a more hospitable habitat than
    the surface, though some small settlements can be found braving the snowy
    expanse. The most prominent city, Åknorg, is a subterranean port on the western
    side of the island accessible by the river Åk that flows into the depths. Lit by
    glowing fungi and brimming with the smells of ale and furnace fire, it is the
    ancestral home and origin of dwarves. The Skünish are irrepressible explorers,
    and claim to have travelled most of the south pole, though on what is there they
    are usually quiet.
</p>
<h2>The Confederate Calendar</h2>
<p>
    The Confederate Calendar was created shortly after its foundation out of
    necessity: the various states and monarchies that formed it used different
    systems of timekeeping. The calendar that Kathrulan scholars created was a
    compromise based mostly on the Lepian system of months and the Mŷrocki system of
    days.
</p>
<p>
    There are five days in a turn, 6 turns in a month, and 12 months and a turn in a
    year. The last turn is imaginatively called 'Last Turn', and is celebrated as a
    five day festival of thanksgiving for the year passed and welcoming the year
    ahead.
</p>
